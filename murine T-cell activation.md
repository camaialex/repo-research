_J Kwak protocol, Houghton Lab, Fred Hutch_

In vitro T cell activation protocol (Mouse)

# Materials
---
- Anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody activators (JK 4C Box 2)
- 96-well round-bottom plate
	- EasySep T-cell kit (19851)
		- Isolation cocktail
		- Rat serum
		- EasySep magnet
		- 5mL Falcon tubes
		- Streptavidin Rapidspheres
- FA3 Buffer
	- DPBS (no Ca, Mg): 500mL
	- 2.5mM EDTA (2.5mL, 0.5M in 500mL)
	- 2% FBS (10mL in 500mL)
	- pH adjusted to 8
- Mouse spleen
- Single-cell suspension supplies (strainers, tubes, DB, etc.)
- [[T-cell media]]
	- RPMI
	- 10% FBS
	- 1% Pen-Strep
	- 50uL Beta-mercaptoethanol
	- IL-2 100 U/mL

# Coat plate (>2 h)
---
1. Dilute anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in PBS to 2.46 ug/mL.  
	
 >[!CAUTION]
 > The concentration here is crucial. Make sure no droplets stick to the outside of the pipette tip.

2. Coat wells (~12/spleen) in 200uL of above solution for at least 2 hours at 37C.
3. Flick off coating solution.
4. Wash wells with 200uL PBS three times. Leave final wash in until T-cells are ready to seed.

# Isolate splenocytes (>20 min)
---
1. Euthanize a mouse and remove its spleen. Keep the spleen as sterile as possible.
2. Press the spleen through a 70-micron filter.
3. [[RBC lysis|RBC-lyse]] (typically 1-2 min at RT).
4. Filter through a 40-micron filter.
5. Move on immediately to T cell isolation.

# T-cell isolation
---
1. Use the EasySep T-cell kit (summarized below) to isolate T cells from the single-cell suspension.
	1. Resuspend cell pellet in 1mL FA-3 and transfer to Falcon tube.
	2. Add 50uL rat serum and 30uL isolation cocktail to the cell pellet. 10 minutes at RT.
	3. Add 30uL Rapidspheres (vortex beads beforehand). 10 minutes at RT.
	4. Dilute with 1.5 mL FA3 buffer.
	5. Put tube on EasySep magnet for 3 minutes at RT.
	6. With tube still on magnet, pour T cell supernatant into a new 15mL conical tube. Do not tap the tube. Whatever remains in the tube is trash.
2. Confirm viability of splenocytes if desired. Spin down cell pellet.
3. Move on immediately to seeding T cells.

# Seed T cells (>10 min)
---
1. Adjust T-cells to a concentration of 500k TOTAL cells/200 uL (2.5E6 cells/mL) in media.
2. Plate 200uL suspension in each coated well. Be careful not to seed in uncoated wells.
3. Spin down the plate at 400g. T cells will proliferate better when aggregated at the bottom.

# Activate T cells (2 days)
---
1. Activate T cells for 2 days. Do not disturb or change media. Watch for media exhaustion.

# Reculture and Harvest T cells (2 days)
---
1. Using a multichannel pipette, forcibly resuspend the cell pellets at the bottoms of the wells. Significant effort is required to lift the bottom-most cells. 

> [!CAUTION]
	> Bubbles are almost inevitable at this step, resulting in loss; avoid as much as possible.

2. Transfer the harvested T cells into a reagent reservoir.
3. Use a small amount of fresh media to wash the wells that were just harvested to maximize yield.
4. Spin T-cells and resuspend in fresh media.
5. Re-plate T-cells at 1/2 a 96-well plate per spleen.
6. One day later, split 1:2 (i.e. a half-plate gets recultured into the full 96 wells)  
7. After two days of activation and two days of reculture, the T-cells can be harvested as described in step 1 of Reculture.
