# Neoplasm

Neoplasm ("_new growth_") is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells.
## Tumors
- When neoplasms grow big enough, they form a firm, palpable outgrowth called a [[tumor]].
## Malignant vs. Benign Neoplasms
Neoplasms can either be **benign** or **malignant**. Malignant neoplasms are usually:
- Irregularly shaped and poorly defined
- Contain areas of necrosis
- Are [[endophytic]] rather than [[exophytic]]
