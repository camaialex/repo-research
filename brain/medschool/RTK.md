# Receptor Tyrosine Kinase

- _Single-pass_ transmembrane proteins that have an intracellular enzymatic region
## Process
1. Ligand binds RTK
2. Two RTKs _dimerize_
3. RTK kinase regions phosphorylate each other
4. Phosphorylated RTKs stimulate downstream signaling
	- [[MAP Kinase pathway]] - proliferative
	- [[PI3 Kinase pathway]] - survival
