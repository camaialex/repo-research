# RTK-MAP Kinase Pathway

**Activating cell pathway**
## Process
1. Ligand binds RTK
2. RTK dimerizes and cross-phosphorylates
3. Monomeric G-protein [[Ras]] is activated
4. Ras phosphorylates [[RAF]]/MAPKKK
5. MAPKKK phosphorylates [[MEK]]/MAPKK
6. MAPKK phosphorylates [[ERK]]/MAPK
7. ERK exerts transcriptional effects
