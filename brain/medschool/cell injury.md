# Cell Injury

## Common Causes
- Infection
- Trauma
- Temperature (heat/freezing)
- Hypoxia
- Insufficient nutrients/hypoglycemia
- Toxins
## Reversible vs. Irreversible Cell Injury
### Potentially reversible cell injury
- **Cannot be reliably detected on histology due to lag between cell death and histology changes**
- Caused by brief and mild exposure
- Features of reversible cell injury
	- Hydropic changes (swelling)
	- Eosinophilia
	- Lipid vacuoles
### Irreversible cell injury
- Caused by chronic and severe exposure, including viral and bacterial infections
- Features of irreversible cell injury
	- **Nuclear** defects
	- Rupture of cell membrane
	- Destruction of organelles
## Adaptations from Cell Injury
- [[hypertrophy]]
- [[hyperplasia]]
- [[atrophy]]
- [[metaplasia]]
## Apoptosis vs. Necrosis
### [[apoptosis]]
- Programmed for development or in response to some infections
- Affects one cell at a time
- Non-immunogenic
- Associated with cell shrinkage
	- Strongly eosinophilic cytosol
### [[necrosis]]
- Not programmed, unintentional
- Affects groups of cells at a time
- Immunogenic
- Associated with cell swelling and lysis
	- Weakly eosinophilic cytosol
## Histological Features of Cell Injury
- Membrane [[blebbing]]
- Pale cytosol
- Nuclear pathology
	- [[karyorrhexis]] - condensation
	- [[karyolysis]] - pallor
	- [[pyknosis]] - condensation
- Cellular swelling
	- Due to insufficient ATP driving the Na/K pump
- Eosinophilia
	- Loss of transcriptional activity which would result in basophilic staining
- Lipid vacuoles
	- Loss of metabolic regulation
