# PI3 Kinase Pathway

Plays a key role in cell survival.
## Process
1. Ligand binds RTK
2. RTKs dimerizes and cross-phosphorylate
3. RTK activates [[PI3 Kinase]]
4. PI3 Kinase phosphrylates PI into [[PIP3]]
5. PIP3 phosphorylates [[PDK1]]
6. PDK1 phosphorylates [[Akt]]
7. Akt phosphorylates [[BAD]]
8. BAD dissociates from [[Bcl2]]
9. Bcl2 drives cell survival programs (in certain contexts)
