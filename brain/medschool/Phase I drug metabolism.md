# Phase I Metabolism

- Mostly mediated by [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes in the liver
	- Other enzymes: 
		- amine oxidases
		- alcohol dehydrogenases
		- esterases
		- amidases
- End product is a more _oxidized/water-soluble_ product that is usually _inactive_
- Very rarely, the metabolized drug is not inactivated:
	- Liver creates active drug from prodrug
	- Liver creates toxic metabolite

## Types of Reactions
- Hydroxylation
- Oxidative dealklyation
