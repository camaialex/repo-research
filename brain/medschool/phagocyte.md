# Phagocytes

Phagocytes are immune cells that _engulf_ and digest pathogens. Some also present antigen as [[APC]]s.

## Varieties of Phagocytes
- [[neutrophil]]
- [[eosinophil]]
- [[macrophage]]
- [[monocyte]]
- [[mast cell]]

## Process of Phagocytosis
1. Endocytosis of pathogen into **phagosome**
2. Fusion of phagosome with **lysosome** (forms phagolysosome)
3. Digestion of pathogen by lysosomal granules
	1. Initial granules lower pH
	2. [[azurophilic]] granules activate
4. [[NADPH oxidase]] produces superoxide; superoxide produces **bleach** (NaOCl) and **HOOH**
