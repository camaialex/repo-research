# Proto-oncogene

A gene that normally provides the _go_ signal for proliferation.
- When mutated, cells cycle uncontrollably (**oncogene**)
- Typical mutation is **GOF**
	- [[missense mutation]]s
## Known Oncogenes
- GPCR
	- [[Ras]] family of monomeric GTPases
	- [[PI3 Kinase]]
- RTK
	- [[Abl]]
	- [[HER]] - activates PI3K
- Growth factors
	- [[EGFR]]
- Special proteins
	- [[BCR_ABL]] fusion chromosome - deregulated when fused
	- [[E7]] and [[E6]] viral oncogenes
		- Inhibits pRB activity and degrades p53 respectively
