# Virus

## Structure
- A virus is actually two parts
	- [[virion]]
	- Virus-infected cell
- Viruses have several structures in common
	- [[capsid]]
	- [[viral surface glycoproteins]]
	- (in some) [[viral envelope]]
## Viral Life Cycle
- **Do not follow log-phase growth**; more of a "burst"
1. Binding to host cell membrane
2. Endocytosis
3. Release of genetic material
4. Synthesis of capsid
5. Synthesis of genome
6. Assembly of virions
7. Exit from host cell

Several outcomes possible after Step 7
1. Lytic infection: virus bursts from cell, killing it
2. Transformation: virus alters cell, possibly causing [[cancer]]
3. Persistent infection: low-grade release of virus from cell without lysis
4. Latency: virus remains dormant within cell without harming it
## Classification
- [[Baltimore classification of viruses]]
- [[DNA viruses]]
- [[RNA viruses]]
## Pathogenic Viruses
- Herpesviruses
	- [[HSV I and II]]
	- [[CMV]]
	- [[EBV]]
## Host Defense
- [[antiviral immunity]]
- [[viral immune evasion]]
## Effects of Viral Disease
- Many viral infections do not result in disease
	- Depends on host factors and virulence
- [[viral shedding]]
- Systemic infection
- [[cytokine storm]]
- Autoimmune disorders
- Immune complexes, complement-mediated damage
## Diagnosis
- [[inclusion bodies]]
## Treatment
