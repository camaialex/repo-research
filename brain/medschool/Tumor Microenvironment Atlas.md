# TME Atlas
_Referring to invasive cancer_
## Components of the TME
### Cells
- [[NK cell]]
	- Recognize cancer cells that have been _opsonized_ by antibody using **Fc receptor**
		- Engage in **antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity**
	- Recognize cancer cells that have downregulated MHC-I
- [[MDSC]]
	- Suppress the T cells responding to tumor
- [[macrophage]]
	- M1: pro-inflammatory
	- M2: immunosuppressive
- [[cytotoxic T cell|Tk]]
	- Engage in cell-mediate killing of tumor cells
- [[helper T cell|Th]]
	- Recognize tumor antigen and activate Tk/B cells and MÃ¸
- [[Treg cell]]
	- Suppress the T cells responding to tumor
- [[B cell]]
	- Secrete tumor-specific antibodies
- [[dendritic cell]]
	- Phagocytose and present cancer cell antigen to Th and Tk cells
### Cytokines
- **Pro-inflammatory**: [[IFNg]], [[TNFa]]
- **Anti-inflammatory**: [[IL-10]], [[TGF-beta]]
## Immunosurveillance and Immunoediting
### Immunosurveillance
- Immune system recognizes and suppresses/kills cancer cells
### Immunoediting
- Cancer gradually escapes the immune response through evolving resistance mechanisms and changing the microenvironment
	- The immune system _drives_ cancer cell evolution through selecting resistant cells
- **Stages of immunoediting**
	1. Elimination - cancer is killed by immune system
	2. Equilibrium - cancer exists in low levels controlled by immune system
	3. Escape - cancer mutates to resist the immune system
## Mechanisms of Immune Evasion
- **Cold** TME - no neoantigen presentation, costimulatory molecules, or adhesion molecules
	- Countered by NK cells
- **Tolerance** - cancer antigens are "self" enough to convince DCs that cancer is self
- **Antigenic modulations** - cancer evolves to lose immunogenic antigen
- **Direct immunosuppression** - cancer secretes immunosuppressive cytokines or expresses immunosuppressive surface proteins (ex. [[PD-L1]])
- **Immune-privileged site** - cancer creates a compartment that excludes immune cells (ex. with collagen)
