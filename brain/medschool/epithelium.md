# Epithelium

Epithelia are generally **cell-rich, ECM-poor** tissues that form the barrier between the body and the outside world.

## Major types of Epithelia
- [[skin]]
- [[mucosa]]
- [[serous membranes]]
- interfaces between environments

## Functions of Epithelia
- Protection
- Selective transport
	- Absorption
	- Secretion
- Lubrication
- Movement of fluids (current)

## Structural Biology of Epithelia
- Epithelium structure
	- [[adherens junction]]s
	- [[hemidesmosome]]s
	- [[desmosome]]s
- Epithelium function
	- [[gap junction]]s
	- [[tight junction]]s
	- [[cilia]]
	- [[microvilli]]
	- [[stereocilia]]
	- [[keratinization]]

## Classification of Epithelia
- **STRATIFICATION**
	- Simple (1 layer)
	- Stratified (multilayered)
- **CELL MORPHOLOGY**
	- Squamous (flat)
	- Cuboidal
	- Columnar
- **SPECIALIZATIONS**
	- Squamous: can be _keratinized_ if stratified
	- Columnar: can be _[[cilia]]ted_
- **EXCEPTIONS**
	- Transitional epithelia: typically stratified, cuboidal apical, may change shape if distended
	- Pseudostratified epithelia: simple epithelium, diverse cell shapes, can look stratified
		- Classified as columnar
- **SPECIAL TYPES OF EPITHELIA**
	- [[skin]]: keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium
	- [[mucosa]]:
		- [[endothelium]]: lines the vascular lumen (simple squamous)
		- [[urogenital epithelium]]: lines the urogenital tract (transitional)
		- [[respiratory epithelium]]: lines the respiratory tract (pseudostratified columnar ciliated)
	- [[serous membranes]]:
		- [[mesothelium]]: lines the internal organs/viscera (simple squamous)
	- interfaces

## Identifying Epithelial Tissue on Histology
- Forms clear barrier
- Cell-dense
- Avascular
- Highly proliferative (mitotic index)
