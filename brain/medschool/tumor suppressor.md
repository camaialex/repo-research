# Tumor Suppressor

A gene that normally _stops_ cell cycling or _induces cell death_ in the event of damage or stress
- When mutated, the cell is unable to stop cycling despite cellular damage
- Typical mutation is **LOF**
	- [[Nonsense mutation]]s that are often truncating
## Known Tumor Suppressors
- [[PTEN]]
	- Converts PIP3 to inactive state
- [[p53]]
	- Multiple mechanisms, DNA repair and apoptosis in event of DNA damage
- [[Rb]]
	- Prevents E2F from promoting transcription of cyclins
- [[APC protein]]
	- Ubiquitinates beta-catenin as part of destruction complex
- DSB repair #todo
	- [[BRCA1]]
	- [[BRCA2]]
- NER Repair
	- [[CHK2]]
	- [[ATM]]
	- [[ATR]]
	- [[BRCA1]]
	- [[BRCA2]]

## Genetics of Tumor Suppressors
- **On the genetic level, the nonfunctional tumor suppressor allele is recessive**
	- Makes a nonfunctional protein
- **On the organismal level, the nonfunctional tumor suppressor allele is dominant**
	- Confers risk if it exists regardless of other allele
- Knudson's **two-hit** hypothesis
	- Retinoblastoma requires two sequential losses of Rb gene function
- Bilateral disease: one deletion is inherited, another is a somatic mutation
- Unilateral disease: both deletions were generated somatically
