# Wnt Signaling Pathway

The Wnt signaling pathway is critical for development.
## Process
1. [[Beta-catenin]] is normally expressed but ubiquitinated by the protein APC in the [[destruction complex]]
2. When [[Fzd]] is bound by [[Wnt]], the GPCR sequesters the destruction complex
3. Beta-catenin is not degraded and is free to exert transcriptional effects
## Pathology
- Mutations in the Wnt-beta-Catenin pathway can lead to forms of cancer
