# Capillaries
## Function
- Allow exchange of nutrients and wastes
	- Water: osmosis through channels and fenestrations
	- Solutes: diffusion through intercellular clefts
	- Small lipophilic molecules: diffusion
	- Large hydrophilic molecules: [[transcytosis]]
## Subtypes
- [[discontinous_sinusoid capillary]]: Cell-cell clefts are permeable
	- Found in endocrine organs
- [[fenestrated capillary]]: Endothelial cells have pores which allow movement of molecules across
	- Found in kidney
- [[continuous capillary]]: Tight junctions prevent movement across endothelium
	- Found in 
## Structure
- [[tunica intima]]: 
- [[tunica media]]: 
- [[tunica adventitia]]:
