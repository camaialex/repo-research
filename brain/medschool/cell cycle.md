# Cell Cycle

## Process
- G0: resting state
- G1: proliferation and protein synthesis
- S: DNA replication
- G2: cellular expansion in preparation for mitosis
- M: mitosis
## Regulation of Cell Cycle
### Proteins
- [[cyclins]] and [[CDKs]]
- [[Rb]]
- [[BRCA1]] and [[BRCA2]] - tumor suppressors involved with DNA repair
- [[DNA damage control]]
### Cell Cycle Checkpoints
- [[cyclin D]]/[[CDK6]]
	- G1 checkpoint
- [[cyclin D]]/[[CDK4]]
	- G1 checkpoint
	- Phosphorylates [[Rb]] to create cyclin E
- [[cyclin E]]/[[CDK2]]
	- Initiate S-phase
	- Commitment to cycling
- [[cyclin A]]/[[CDK2]]
	- Initiate DNA replication
- [[cyclin A]]/[[CDK1]]
	- Initiate G2
- [[cyclin B]]/[[CDK1]]
	- Initiate anaphase
