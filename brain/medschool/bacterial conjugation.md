# Bacterial Conjugation

- Process by which bacteria **gain** new [[plasmid]]s from other bacteria (**don't have to be same species**)
## Process
1. Donor/F+ bacterium uses sex [[pilli]] to connect to the other/F- bacterium's cytoplasm
2. Plasmid replicates and new strand travels through the sex pilus
