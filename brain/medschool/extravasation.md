# Extravasation

- Process by which leukocytes **infiltrate** blood vessels

## Process of Extravasation
1. Leukocytes engage in [[leukocyte rolling]] along blood vessel
2. As they near the site of injury, leukocytes begin to express [[integrin]]s due to [[chemokine]] gradient
3. At the site of injury, leukocytes are _halted_
4. Leukocytes _squeeze_ through gaps in the endothelium
