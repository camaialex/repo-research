# Cancer Therapy

## Alkylating Agents
- Nitrogen mustards ex. [[cyclophosphamide]]
- Platinum compounds ex. [[oxaliplatin]], [[carboplatin]], [[cisplatin]]
_General mechanism_: induce cell death by crosslinking and adducting to DNA
## Topoisomerase inhibitors
- Anthracyclines: [[doxorubicin]]
- TopoI inhibitors: [[topotecan]]
- TopoII inhibitors: [[etoposide]]
_General mechanism_: prevent replication and transcription by preventing unwinding of DNA
## Antimetabolites
- Nucleotide analogues: [[5-fluorouracil]]
- Nucleotide synthesis inhibitors: [[methotrexate]]
_General mechanism_: prevent replication by interfering with nucleotide synthesis
## Microtubule inhibitors
- Polymerization: vinca alkaloids like [[vincristine]], [[vinblastine]]
- Catastrophe: [[paclitaxel]], [[docetaxel]]
_General mechanism_: prevent replication by interfering with cytoskeletal microtubules
