# Galpha-q

## Process
1. Ligand binds GPCR
2. Gq stimulates [[phospholipase C]]
3. Phospholipase C cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into [[IP3]] and [[DAG]]
4. [[IP3]] stimulates calcium release from [[endoplasmic reticulum]]
5. [[DAG]] under **high calcium** stimulates [[Kinase C]] which begins a protein phosphorylation cascade
6. Cell is depolarized and a response occurs
