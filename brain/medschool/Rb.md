# Rb (retinoblastoma)

Rb is a [[tumor suppressor]] gene involved in regulating the initiation of the cell cycle.
## Regulation by Rb
- Rb in its _base_ state:
	- _Sequesters_ a protein ([[E2F1]]) that binds the promoter for [[cyclin E]]
	- _Binds/stabilizes_ a protein ([[E2F4]]) that binds the repressor for cyclin E
- Rb is _phosphorylated_ by [[cyclin D]]/[[CDK4]]
	- Releases E2F1 and E2F4
	- Cyclin E is transcribesd
## Genetics of Retinoblastoma
- Knudson's **two-hit** hypothesis
	- Retinoblastoma requires two sequential losses of Rb gene function
- Bilateral disease: one deletion is inherited, another is a somatic mutation
- Unilateral disease: both deletions were generated somatically
