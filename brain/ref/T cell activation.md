(Back to [[T cell]])
# T Cell Activation

## Activating [[naive T-cell]]s
1. Inciting event is **antigen-binding**
2. Forming [[immune synapse]] (costimulatory molecules):
3. Further proliferative **cytokine** signals and [[Th polarization]]
		- [[IL-2]]
		- [[IL-12]]
		- Polarizing cytokines
- Triggers differentiation into [[effector T-cell]]s and [[memory T-cell]]s
	- Effector T cells die after resolution, while memory T cells persist
- T cell is now considered _licensed_ to kill
## Activating [[memory T-cell]]s
1. Only event required is **antigen-binding** because cell is already licensed
