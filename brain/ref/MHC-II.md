# MHC-II

**Major Histocompatibility Complex II** is a surface protein expressed on [[APC]]s.
## Structure
- Alpha chain
	- Alpha1, Alpha2
- Beta chain
	- Beta1, Beta2
- Binding site: Alpha1, Beta1 cleft
- Interacts with [[TCR]] and accessory [[CD4]] receptor
## Function
- Presents **exogenous** antigen
	- Pathogens that were endocytosed
- Antigen processed through [[endocytic pathway for antigen]] #todo
- Presents antigen to [[helper T cell|Th]] cells to signal activation
- _Promiscuous_: can bind multiple antigen
## Genetics
- HLA loci are extremely diverse
- Major loci
	- HLA-DP
	- HLA-DQ
	- HLA-DR
## Pathology
- MHC-II polymorphisms implicated in several diseases:
	- [[type 1 diabetes]]
	- [[SLE]]
	- [[rheumatoid arthritis]]
	- [[celiac disease]]
