# MHC-I

**Major histocompatibility complex I** is a surface protein expressed on **all nucleated cells**.
## Structure
- 4 subunits
	- Alpha chain
		- (alpha 1-3)
	- Beta chain
		- [[beta microglobulin]]
- Interacts with [[TCR]] and accessory [[CD8]] receptor
- Binding site: Alpha1, Beta1 cleft
## Function
- Presents **endogenous** antigen
	- Viral particles from an infection
	- Normal proteins
- Antigen processed through [[cytosolic pathway for antigen]] #todo 
- Can signal for a [[cytotoxic T cell|CD8+ T cell]] to engage in [[cell-mediated killing]] #todo if a cell is infected
- _Promiscuous_: can bind multiple antigen
## Genetics
- HLA loci are extremely diverse
- Major loci
	- HLA-A
	- HLA-B
	- HLA-C
