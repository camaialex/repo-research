# Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC)

Almost every cell can present antigen.
## Structure
- Antigen is presented on MHC molecules to assist with [[T cell activation]]
- Forms part of immune synapse
	- [[CD80]]/[[CD86]] - general danger signal expressed during inflammation
		- B7 family of costimulatory markers
	- [[LFA-3]]
	- [[ICAM-1]]
## Professional Antigen-Presenting Cells
Only some present antigen **professionally**. They do so using [[MHC-II]]
### [[dendritic cell]]s
- The most effective APCs
- Express MHC-II _constitutively_ at high levels
- Express costimulatory markers _constitutively_
### [[B cell]]s
- Express MHC-II _constitutively_
- Require _stimulation_ to express costimulatory molecules
### [[macrophage]]s
- Need to be _stimulated_ by phagocytosis to express MHC-II
- Require _stimulation_ by phagocytosis to express costimulatory molecules

## Other APCs
Some cells can be induced to present antigen on [[MHC-II]] under the right conditions:
- Granulocytes (including [[mast cell]]s and [[neutrophil]]s)
- [[endothelial cell]]s
- [[epithelial cell]]s
- Skin [[fibroblast]]s
- [[endothelial cell]]s
- [[glial cell]]s
- [[beta cell]]s
