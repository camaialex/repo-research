## Abstract
- Sought to clarify effects of **lipid metabolism** (lipidome) on CD8+ T-cell function
- [[Naive T-cell]]s have rich in polyunsaturated [[phosphoinositide]]s
	- [[CD8]]+ [[effector T-cell]]s have increased amounts of saturated PIs
	- Loss of saturated PIs negatively impacted effector function
