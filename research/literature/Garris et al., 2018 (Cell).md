## Successful Anti-PD-1 Cancer Immunotherapy Requires T Cell-Dendritic Cell Crosstalk Involving the Cytokines IFN-Î³ and IL-12
---
## Abstract
- Discovered subset of [[dendritic cell|DC]]s that secrete [[IL-12]] crucial for [[T cell]] responses to cancer
	- Sensed [[IFNg]] upon [[PD-1]] therapy
		- Secreted IL-12
			- Stimulated T-cell antitumor immunity
- Pathway also stimulated by non-canonical [[NFkB]] pathway activation
