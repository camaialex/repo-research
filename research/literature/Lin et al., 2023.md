# Small intestine and colon tissue-resident memory CD8+Â T cells exhibit molecular heterogeneity and differential dependence on Eomes
---
## Abstract
- Tissue-resident memory [[cytotoxic T-cell|CD8+ T-cell]]s play crucial role in initial immune response
- The heterogeneity and context-specificity of Trm cells in different anatomic compartments is underappreciated

- Intestinal and colon Trm exhibited unique cytokine and granzyme expression and epigenetic, transcriptomic, and functional heterogeneity
- [[Eomes]] (T-box transcription factor) exhibited context-dependent effects
