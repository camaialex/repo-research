# SHP-2 and PD-1-SHP-2 signaling regulate myeloid cell differentiation and antitumor responses
---
## Abstract
- PD-1 suppresses [[T-cell]] activation by recruiting SHP-2 phosphatase
- SHP-2 knockout does nothing in T-cells
- SHP-2 knockout in [[MDSC|MDSC]]s and [[TAM]]s results in activation of immunostim. programs
- SHP-2 appears to **restrict** myeloid differentiation resulting in an immunosuppressive microenvironment
