# Visualizing cell-cell communication using synthetic notch activated MRI
---
## Abstract
- Cell-based immunotherapies rely on direct engagement of tumor antigen
- Using [[synthetic Notch]] platform
	- T-cells that express a MRI reporter gene (OATP1B3) (that is imagable) upon engaging a tumor antigen
