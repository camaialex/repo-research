## Postoperative Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Secrete IFNÎ± to Promote Recruitment of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells and Drive Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence
---
## Abstract
- [[IFNa|IFNalpha]] was identified is a risk factor for [[hepatocellular carcinoma|HCC]] recurrence from a large cytokine array
- IFNalpha is primarily secreted by [[plasmacytoid DC]]s (pDCs)
	- pDCs seem to be activated following surgical resection
		- IFNalpha attracts [[MDSC]]s
			- MDSCs drive tumor recurrence
