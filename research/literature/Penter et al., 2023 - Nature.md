# Mitochondrial DNA mutations as natural barcodes for lineage tracing of murine tumor models
---
## Abstract
- ATAC-Seq was used on a single-cell level to detect mtDNA mutations, CNV, and chromatin changes in murine models of cancer
- These changes were used to infer the lineage of tumor cells in development
