# CD25 (IL2RA)

_From Wikipedia_

Interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (also called CD25) is the human protein encoded by the IL2RA gene.

It is a type I transmembrane protein present on activated [[T-cell]]s, activated [[B-cell]]s, some thymocytes, myeloid precursors, and oligodendrocytes. Though IL2RA has been used as a marker to identify CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells in mice, it has been found that a large proportion of resting memory T cells constitutively express IL2RA in humans.

IL2RA is expressed in most B-cell neoplasms, some acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, neuroblastomas, mastocytosis and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. It functions as the receptor for HTLV-1 and is consequently expressed on neoplastic cells in adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia. Its soluble form, called sIL-2R may be elevated in these diseases and is occasionally used to track disease progression.
