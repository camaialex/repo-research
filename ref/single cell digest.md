# Procedure Name
---
> [!SUMMARY]+
> A brief description of the objectives of the experiment

> [!CAUTION]+
> Tissue digests should be performed in a team of at least two if there are more than 5 samples to process. It is a long, time-consuming process and an entire day should be reserved for this experiment alone.

# Materials
---
 - 70-micron and 40-micron cell strainer
- 2mL Eppendorf tubes and 50mL conical tubes
- FA3 Buffer
	- DPBS (no Ca, Mg): 500mL
	- **2.5mM** EDTA (2.5mL, 0.5M in 500mL)
	- **2%** FBS (10mL in 500mL)
	- pH adjusted to **8**
- RPMI 1640 (L-Gln, HEPES), serum-free
- “Blunt” P-1000 tips (End trimmed by razor to expose wider mouth) _OR_ syringe with small-gauge needle
- 1mL syringe plungers
- [[ACK Lysis Buffer]]
- Sterile-filtered 10x digestion buffer (Recipe 1)
	- **320mg** Collagenase **II**
	- **75mg** Elastase
	- **20mg** Soybean trypsin inhibitor
	- **10mL** RPMI
OR

- Sterile-filtered 10x digestion buffer (Recipe 2)
	- **274mg** Collagenase **IV**
	- **20mg** Soybean trypsin inhibitor
	- **10mL** RPMI
	- 1 tablet **Pierce protease inhibitor w/EDTA** per 20-30mL buffer


# Procedure
---
# Prep
---
1. Begin thawing digestion buffer and DNase before beginning anything else.
	1. Use ~2mL 1x digestion buffer for every 0.5g tissue. 
2. Prepare 1x digestion buffer.
	1. Dilute 1mL 10x digestion buffer in 9mL RPMI
> [!CAUTION]+
> Don't use RPMI with protein (i.e. FBS) because this inhibits the digestive enzymes
2. Add 40uL DNase (stock 20,000U/mL)

# Mechanical Dissociation / Digestion
---
1. Isolate the tissue of interest and hold in ice-cold FA3 or RPMI until ready to process.
2. Mechanically dissociate the tissue. The preferred method (if samples aren’t too big):
	1. Place sample in a 2mL Eppendorf tube with 1mL digestion buffer.
	2. Snip with scissors until the sample is no longer chunky ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Keep the sample wet.
	3. Keep the tube cool to avoid activating the collagenase.
	4. Use a blunt P-1000 pipette tip to transfer the sample to a 50mL conical tube.
	5. Add remaining 1x digestion buffer to the 2mL tube, wash, and transfer to 50mL tube.
3. Incubate samples at 37C for 15 minutes.
4. Mix samples vigorously with a pipette or syringe. Use this to break up chunkier bits of tissue.
5. Incubate samples at 37C for an additional 15 minutes.
6. Dilute digestion buffer with at least 1 volume FA3 to cancel the reaction.
> [!NOTE]
> The timing of this step is important. Tubes towards the end of the line will be over-digested if not cancelled quickly.

# Straining
---
1. Pour samples through 70-micron strainer. Use a 1mL syringe plunger as a pestle.
2. Push larger chunks of tissue through with the pestle, washing often with FA3.
3. Wash the strainers one more time to fill up all tubes to the same volume. Discard the strainer.
4. Centrifuge samples at 400G for 3 min.
5. Aspirate supernatant.

# RBC Lysis
---
> [!CAUTION]+
> The timing of this step is **especially** important because RBC lysis, if allowed to go on for even a few minutes longer than expected, can seriously impact the viability of the sample. 
> - Consider skipping the RBC lysis and going straight to 40-micron filter if the sample is not too bloody.
> - If RBC lysis is necessary for a large number of tubes, consider doing them in "waves."
1. Add ~3 mL of RBC lysis buffer to each pellet. Mix vigorously.
2. Allow samples to lyse for 2 to 2.5 minutes but no more than 3 minutes.
3. Dilute RBC lysis buffer with at least 3 volumes of FA3 to cancel the reaction.
4. Pour samples through 40-micron strainer. No pestle is needed.
5. Wash the strainers to fill up all tubes to the same volume. Discard the strainer.
6. Centrifuge samples at 400G for 3 min.
7. Aspirate supernatant.
8. Repeat steps 14-20 once more if the pellet remains red.
9. The cells can now be used for a variety of applications (immune cell isolation, flow, etc.)

# Troubleshooting and Tips
---
- **Strain and wash cells thoroughly**. Cells can get stuck in the strainer if washed insufficiently. Most of the cells are lost in the straining steps.
- Failing to break the tissue into small enough pieces results in inefficient digestion.
- Be sure to sterilize and wipe reusable tools (ex. scissors) dry after every sample.
- Grind the tissue hard into the strainer but **stop when it becomes gooey**. This is a sign that cells are rupturing and/or you are pushing fat through, which makes the pellet loose.
- Be ready to change 70-micron strainers if the first one gets clogged.
