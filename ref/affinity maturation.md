# Affinity Maturation

In immunology, affinity maturation is the process by which [[follicular helper T-cell|Tfh]] cell-activated [[B cell]]s produce antibodies with increased affinity for antigen during the course of an immune response. 
- With repeated exposures to the same antigen, a host will produce antibodies of successively greater affinities.
- A secondary response can elicit antibodies with several fold greater affinity than in a primary response. 

Affinity maturation primarily occurs on membrane immunoglobulin of [[germinal center]] B cells and as a direct result of **somatic hypermutation (SHM)** and **clonal selection** by TFH cells. [1]
