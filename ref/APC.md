# Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC)
---
Almost every cell can present antigen.

Only some present antigen **professionally**:
- [[B-cell]]s
- [[Macrophage]]s
- [[Dendritic cell]]s

Some cells can be induced to present antigen on MHCII under the right conditions:
- Granulocytes (including [[mast cell]]s and [[neutrophil]]s)
- [[endothelial cell]]s
- [[epithelial cell]]s
