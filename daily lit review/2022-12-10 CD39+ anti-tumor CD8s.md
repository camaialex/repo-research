# CD39+ tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells with a clonal overlap across compartments mediate antitumor immunity in breast cancer

## Summary
- Among the tissue-resident population of T-cells in patients with metastatic breast cancer, CD39+ cells represented a subgroup of tumor-specific exhausted T-cells
- ICI seemed to restore cytotoxic activity of exhausted CD39+ cells

## Innovative Methods Used
- 

## Major findings and relevance
