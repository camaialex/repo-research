# IL-23R-activated STAT3/STAT4 is essential for Th1/Th17-mediated CNS autoimmunity

- What factors influence the differentiation of T-cells into disease-causing cells?
	- IL-6 and IL-12 induce IL23 receptor (IL23R)
		- IL-23 signals through STAT3 and STAT4
			- Leads to encephalitogenic T-cells (CNS toxicity)
