# Postoperative Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Secrete IFNÎ± to Promote Recruitment of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells and Drive Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence

## Summary
- IFNalpha was identified is a risk factor for HCC recurrence from a large cytokine array
- IFNalpha is primarily secreted by plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs)
	- pDCs seem to be activated following surgical resection
		- IFNalpha attracts MDSCs
			- MDSCs drive tumor recurrence
