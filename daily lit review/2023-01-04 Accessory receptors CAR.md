# Inefficient exploitation of accessory receptors reduces the sensitivity of chimeric antigen receptors

- Big problem: CARs are limited by a lack of antigen sensitivity, the origins of which remain uncharacterized
- Accessory T-cell receptors seem to be instrumental to boosting antigen sensitivity
	- Just presenting purified antigen is not the same as interfacing with an APC
	- What is the metric for antigen sensitivity?
- CD2 and LFA-1 accessory receptors are instrumental in TCR stimulation but not CARs
- Enhancing sensitivity by:
	- Fusing CAR to the CD3(epsilon) domain
	- Replacing the TCRalpha/beta region with CAR
	- Thereby exploiting full potential of accessory receptors
