# Continuous germinal center invasion contributes to the diversity of the immune response


## Summary
- Characterized mechanism by which [[def_affinity-maturation|affinity maturation]] and antibody diversification occur
	- B-cells invade germinal centers and compete for help from T-cells
	- The higher-affinity B-cells manage to proliferate more
	- Invaders at later stages diversify the response by contributing lower-affinity antibodies to immunogens
