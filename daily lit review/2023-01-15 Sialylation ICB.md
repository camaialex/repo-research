# Immune checkpoint therapy-elicited sialylation of IgG antibodies impairs antitumorigenic type I interferon responses in hepatocellular carcinoma

- Does ICB affect the humoral immune response?
- Tandem mass spectrometry of IgG
	- Effector T-cells triggere sialylation of IgG
		- Dependent on IFNg
- DC-SIGN+ macrophages interacted with sialylated IgG
	- Raf1
		- ATF3
			- Inactivated cGAS-STING
				- Inactivated T1 interferon-mediated antitumor immunity
- Represents a mechanism of blunting antitumor immunity that should be targeted
