# Clonal expansion and epigenetic inheritance of long-lasting NK cell memory

## Summary
- Clonal expansion of NK cells detected in HCMV+ individuals
	- Stable epigenetic signature corresponding to inflammatory memory signature
- Inheritance of epigenetic state across generations maintains memory phenotype

## Innovative Methods Used
- Single-cell multiomic maps of ex-vivo NK cells
	- Endogenous barcoding via mtDNA

## Major findings and relevance
