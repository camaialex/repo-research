# Single-cell immune profiling reveals thymus-seeding populations, [[T-cell|T cell]] commitment, and multilineage development in the human thymus

## Summary
- Deep single-cell profiling of the thymus immune microenvironment
- Identified "seeding populations"
- Relevant to hematopoeitic regeneration therapy

## Innovative Methods Used
- scRNA-seq
- **Spectral flow cytometry** for T-cell differentiation profiling
