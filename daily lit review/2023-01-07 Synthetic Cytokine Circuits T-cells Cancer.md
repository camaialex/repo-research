# Synthetic cytokine circuits that drive T cells into immune-excluded tumors

- CAR-T cells are only effective when the immunosuppressive microenvironment is cleared
- Solution: engineered synthetic **cytokine circuits**
	- Tumor specific synNotch receptors
	- Induce expression of IL-2 in the TME
		- Does so **independently** of TCR or CAR, meaning that local inhibition of TCR/CAR signaling does not counter the effect of IL-2
