# Opioid-induced fragile-like regulatory T cells contribute to withdrawal

- The immune system plays a key role in opioid addiction
- Opioid dependence correlated with upregulation of "fragile-like" [[Treg cell|Treg]]s
	- Recapitulated in murine model
		- Tregs expressing [[IFNg]]
- IFNg signaling from Tregs reshaped synapses in [[nucleus accumbens]]
	- Controlled withdrawal symptoms
- Treg infiltration
	- Enabled through disruption of blood-brain barrier
		- CCL2
		- Downregulation of astrocyte-derived [[FABP7]]
