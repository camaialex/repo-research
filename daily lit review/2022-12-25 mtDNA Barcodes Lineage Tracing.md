# Mitochondrial DNA mutations as natural barcodes for lineage tracing of murine tumor models

## Summary
- ATAC-Seq was used on a single-cell level to detect mtDNA mutations, CNV, and chromatin changes in murine models of cancer
- These changes were used to infer the lineage of tumor cells in development

## Innovative Methods Used
- mtsc[[tech_atac-seq|ATAC-Seq]]

## Major findings and relevance
