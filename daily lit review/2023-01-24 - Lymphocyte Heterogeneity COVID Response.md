# A sex-biased imbalance between Tfr, Tph, and atypical B cells determines antibody responses in COVID-19 patients

- There is a sex bias in how patients respond to COVID-19
- Used [[single-cell proteomics]] to detect very rare subsets of immune cells
- Disruption of humoral immunity in COVID-19 patients
	- Loss of [[circulating follicular regulatory T-cells]] (cTfr)
		- More exaggerated in males
	- Opposing trend of extrafollicular humoral immunity and neutralizing antibodies
		- More exaggerated in males
		- Increased [[peripheral helper T-cell]]
		- Increased [[plasma blast]]
		- Proliferating/extrafollicular [[CD11c+ B-cells]]
