# Neutrophil-activating therapy for the treatment of cancer

- What if we activated neutrophils to kill cancer
- Neutrophils can control tumor growth through the following immunotherapies:
	- [[TNF]]
	- [[CD40]] agonist
	- Tumor-binding antibody
	- Activates cytolytic properties of neutrophils
- Mechanism of immunotherapy:
	- Neutrophil invasion of tumor
	- [[complement system|Complement]] activation
		- [[C5a]] activates neutrophils to produce [[leukotriene B4]]
			- B4 stimulates [[reactive oxygen species]] production via [[xanthine oxidase]]
