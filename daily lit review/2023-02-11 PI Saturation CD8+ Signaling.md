# Phosphoinositide acyl chain saturation drives CD8+Â effector T cell signaling and function

- Sought to clarify effects of **lipid metabolism** (lipidome) on CD8+ T-cell function

- [[Naive T-cell]]s have rich in polyunsaturated [[phosphoinositide]]s
	- [[CD8]]+ [[effector T-cell]]s have increased amounts of saturated PIs
	- Loss of saturated PIs negatively impacted effector function
