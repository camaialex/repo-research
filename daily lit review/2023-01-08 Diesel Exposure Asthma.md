# Maternal diesel particle exposure promotes offspring asthma through NK cellâ€“derived granzyme B

- Problem: children who grow up near highly trafficked roads are more likely to develop asthma
	- Culprit is likely diesel exhaust particles
		- Verified in mouse model
		- Occurs through reprogramming of NK cells
			- Mice that lacked NK cells did not develop analogue of asthma upon exposure to diesel exhaust
		- Mechanism:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230108173620.png]]
			- NK cell expressing GATA3 secretes GZMB and IL13
				- GZMB cleaves PAR2 to activate it
				- IL13 binds IL13R in the airway epithelium
			- Simulated airway epithelium secretes IL25
				- IL25 stimulates Th2s and ILC2s
