# Successful Anti-PD-1 Cancer Immunotherapy Requires T Cell-Dendritic Cell Crosstalk Involving the Cytokines IFN-Î³ and IL-12


## Summary
- Discovered subset of DCs that secrete IL-12 crucial for T-cell responses to cancer
	- Sensed IFNg upon PD-1 therapy
		- Secreted IL-12
			- Stimulated T-cell antitumor immunity
- Pathway also stimulated by non-canonical NFkB pathway activation

## Innovative Methods Used
- Intravital real-time imaging
- scRNA Seq

## Major findings and relevance
