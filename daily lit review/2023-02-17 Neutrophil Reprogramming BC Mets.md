# Immunosuppressive reprogramming of neutrophils by lung mesenchymal cells promotes breast cancer metastasis

- Are the immunomodulatory properties of neutrophils intrinsic or acquired?
	- BMNeu are not immunosuppressive, but lung-invading neutrophils are
- Immunosuppression exists in _steady state_ and is reinforced by inflammation
- The stroma regulates neutrophil immunosuppression
	- [[CD140a]]+ mesenchymal cells
		- Via [[PTGS2]]-mediated production of [[PGE2]]
