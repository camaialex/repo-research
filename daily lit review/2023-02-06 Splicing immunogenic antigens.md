# Noncanonical splicing junctions between exons and transposable elements represent a source of immunogenic recurrent neo-antigens in patients with lung cancer

- Non-canonical transcripts can encode cancer [[neoantigen]]
	- [[lncRNA]]s
	- [[transposable element]]s
- Using human NSCLC samples, identified splicing junctions that were immunogenic
	- Recapitulated *in vitro*
