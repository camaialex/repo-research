## Gating Strategy
- Should draw the same CD45 gate for both lymphoid and myeloid panels
- CXCR3 staining is not great...
- CD25 might need an FMO due to smear
- Need to balance tumor size with tumor treatability
- CD45 should look the same, look at lymphoid panel again
- Antibody issue > voltage issue
- DC definition: CD11c+MHCII+
	- Take a look again
- Why can't detect SigF/11c?
	- +/+ is a TAM phenotype?
- Spenic macrophage definition
- Find out what CD64 is a marker for
- CD64 is an Fc receptor
	- Make sure TruStain doesn't block it
- Find in the literature how CD24 and CD64 are used
- Within the MHCII+ population, plot CD11c vs. MHCII to detect DCs (+/+)
- CD103 as a marker
	- Find a good reason to put it in
- Make sure the populations are immediately useful to the study
- Add B cells CD19+/B220+
- What about a more general definition of macrophages? Make panel more efficient
