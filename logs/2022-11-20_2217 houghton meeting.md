General responsibilities

TC - Michael
* water bath
* incubator maintenance
* emptying tc traps
* ln2 tank
* cleaning hoods
* media supplies
* aliquoting common reagents
* 


## Lab Maintenance
- **Lab shutdown (should be delegated to the last person to leave)**
	- **Liquid nitrogen tanks filled - a job for the new tech**
	- pH meter stored properly
	- Checking fume hood and TC hoods
	- Checking appliances are off especially hot plates
- **Replacing the water in the water baths**
- Keeping an up-to-date inventory of the freezers
- Monitoring AND ordering common lab supplies (if people could help me monitor the supplies that would be ideal)
- **Buying almost all supplies (can easily transition to people buying their own stuff)**
- Making house-made reagents
	- FA-3 / FACS buffer
	- Avertin
	- Gel drying solution
	- RBC lysis buffer
	- IHC buffers
	- **Diluting 70% EtOH** - People should just do it when they see it empty...
	- **1% tergazyme** - this one is especially bothersome because it requires some waiting/heating
- Hounding Housekeeping for paper towels
- Cleaning the vacuum traps - people have usually done a good job of emptying it when full
- Taking out the biohazard waste
- Decontaminating the incubators (we've been having a bacterial contamination problem which makes this more pertinent) and making sure the water is topped off
* SPORE freezer management - SOMEONE NEEDS TO GET ON THIS
* Sending lab meeting update emails and keeping up to date on the schedule
* Making sure people's birthdays are celebrated - XD is up next
* Mailing the printer toners to HP to recycle them
* Keeping up cell culture supplies
	* FBS
	* Pen Strep
	* DMEM because the media room always runs low
* Autoclave: loading and unloading items
* Surgical tools and boards cannot sit out in the sink overnight - they must soak in tergazyme or bleach respectively and get put away next morning
* Swapping out the CDOX at our mouse station in the lab

## Colony Management
- **PL / KP pipeline - if I could have a partner this would be a lot simpler**
	- Reading all CT scans
	- Scheduling CT scans
	- Administering cre
- **Purchasing mice - individual investigators can easily do this themselves**
- **Upkeep of colony database - everyone needs to be active in keeping this up-to-date, not just Jeff**
	- The downside of more people helping is that there is more room for errors in the colony management spreadsheet
- Genotyping mice
	- **OT-1 genotyping via flow; always easier with two people**
	- Ear-tag genotyping via PCR
		- Don't have to genotype the breeders if not Kras
		- If someone could help me do one or more of the following so I can pick up when I get upstairs
			- Ear tag digests
			- PCR
			- Running the gel
			- Imaging the gel
- **Culling mice** - I identify the mice to cull, but since I have to be in 219 during smoking, the culling is something I can't do while the machine is running
- Weaning mice
- **Setting up breeders and gauging usage (need investigators to TELL me exactly what to do with their mice) if they can't come downstairs to do it themselves**
	- If we have everyone pitching in for mouse work, we could start doing triad breeders
- Purchasing, aliquoting, and administering Cre
- Maintaining levels of supplies down in 219 (needles, genotyping supplies, cigarettes, lighters)
	* **Surapat could usually count on me to bring him supplies he forgot on his way down but lately nobody has been replying to my requests and I've had to run up to get it myself**
* "Surgical assistant" for ortho injections - prep cells, needles, and hand them to Jeff while he's conducting the procedure
* Flank injections for Jeff

## Projects
* Smoking project
	* Running the smoking machine
	* Maintaining the smoking cell lines
* Helping out on any single-cell digests going on in lab
* Immunogenic chemotherapy project
* Human T-cell homing project w/Diane
* UW Lehnert collaboration
	* Prep PL mice
	* Attend imaging sessions
	* Treat mice IP with PD-1 antibody
* UW Zeng collaboration
	* Process IHC samples and exchange with Dani
* Jeff's projects
	* Jeff has taken over responsibility of his own cell lines for now
	* **"Project 24" - has been on hold since Surapat left**
		* Stimulating cancer cell lines with IFNg and detecting release of chemokines CXCL5/9/10/11
			* Would be a great project for the new tech to learn cell culture
	* Drying the gels (Grace handles this mostly)
	* NORTIS chip
		* SCD, live-cell staining, culture
	* T-cell activation, both human and mouse
		* Human takes the longest BUT it also requires you to come to the lab regularly...
* Any one-off collaborations get redirected to me usually (ex. Lampe)
* PL cell line
	* Still need to expand, test, and freeze
* Biospecimen processing - I'm a backup in case Parker isn't available for a biospecimen
