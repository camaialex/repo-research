# [[proj_immunogenic-chemo|Ox/Cy]] Project 4

__Objective__: To figure out the lymphoid and myeloid panels.

## Procedure
1. Harvest tumor-bearing lungs and spleen, perform single-cell digests
	* [[sop_mouse_dissection]]
	* [[sop_mouse_perfusion]]
	- [[sop_mouse_scd-tumor]]
	- [[sop_mouse_scd-spleen]]

2. Split samples into groups:
	1. Unstained Tumor x 1
	2. Stained Tumor x 2 (one for each panel)
	3. Unstained Spleen x 1
	4. Stained Spleen x 2

3. Stain and run flow cytometry
