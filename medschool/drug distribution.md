# Drug Distribution

- Once drug is absorbed into the **plasma compartment**, it must be _distributed_ into the tissue.

## Pharmacokinetic Dose Calculation
**Cp = dose / Vd**
- Cp = plasma concentration
- dose = drug dose
- [[volume of distribution|Vd]] = volume of distribution
## Rate of Distribution
- Generally not consequential _except_ when very slow
	- Can result in [[bolus toxicity]] when drug is administered too quickly
## Factors Influencing Distribution
- Charge/polarity
	- Highly dependent on drug pKa
	- **Nonpolar drugs can diffuse across tissues more easily**
	- Drugs can be [[ion trap]]ped in body compartments
- Lipophilicity
	- Related to charge
	- **Lipophilic drugs can diffuse across tissues more easily**
- Size
	- **Smaller drugs diffuse across tissues more easily**
- Concentration gradient
