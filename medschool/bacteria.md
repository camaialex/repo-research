# Bacteria

## Structure/Virulence Factors
- [[bacterial cell wall]]
- [[pilli]]
- [[flagellum]]
- [[plasmid]]
- [[capsule]]
- [[type III secretion system]]
- [[endospore]]
## Function
- [[bacterial metabolism]]
- [[bacterial reproduction]]
## Colonization
- Bacteria make up an _essential_ part of our microbiome
- Not all bacteria cause disease when we are exposed to them
	- Colonization and symbiosis / commensalism
	- Infection _formally_ refers to any relationship between bacteria and host
	- Disease often arises due to host factors such as immunopathology
- Whether bacteria colonize or invade depends on **host, environment, and microbe**
	- Host: immunocompetence
	- Environment: in or outside of hospital
	- Microbe: [[bacterial virulence]], location of colonization
## Common Pathogenic Bacteria
- Aerobic bacteria
	- Gram-positive bacteria
		- [[Staphylococcus aureus]]
		- [[Streptococcus pyogenes]]
		- [[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]
- Anaerobic bacteria
	- Gram-negative rods
		- Clostridium spp.
			- [[Clostridium difficile]]
## Host Defense
- [[antibacterial immunity]]
- [[bacterial immune evasion]]
## Diagnostics
- [[Gram stain]]
- [[acid fast stain]]
