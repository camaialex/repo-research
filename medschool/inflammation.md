# Inflammation

## Steps in Inflammation
1. Recognize
	- [[PRR]]s
	- [[cytokine]]s
	- [[eicosanoid]]s
1. Recruit
	- [[chemokine]]s and extravasation
2. Remove
	- [[phagocyte|phagocytosis]] mostly by [[neutrophil]]s and [[macrophage]]s
	- Phagocytes mediate antigen presentation
3. Regulate
	- [[Treg cell|Treg]]
4. Resolve
## Effects of Inflammation
### Immune Effects
- [[neutrophil]]s are the first responders to an acute inflammatory event
### Vascular Effects
- [[hyperemia]] caused by vasodilation
	- Mediated by [[histamine]], [[NO]], [[prostaglandin]]s
- Stasis - slowing of blood flow
- Expression of adhesion molecules on vasculature
### General Effects
- Rubor, tumor, dolor, calor, loss of function
- [[fever]]
## Pathology
- [[primary chronic inflammation]]
