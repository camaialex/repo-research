# Embryonic Folding

- Week 4
- Critical for forming the [[body wall]]
- [[caudal agenesis]] possible at this stage

## Steps in Folding
1. [[neuropore]] closure (cranial, then caudal)
2. Embryo folds cranially, caudally, and laterally towards the umbilicus
3. Results of folding:
	- Fully enclosed [[central nervous system]]
	- Endoderm-derived [[gut tube]]
	- Differentiated mesoderm layers
4. Primitive streak and node degenerate completely
