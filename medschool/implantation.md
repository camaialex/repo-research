# Implantation

## Steps in Implantation
1. The [[trophoblast]] (outer layer of cells) begins implanting into the uterus
	- If the [[cilia]] in the [[Fallopian tube]] fail to draw the egg in, [[ectopic pregnancy]] can result
	- **Prime real estate** is in the superior uterus, where carbohydrate stores are plentiful
	- The area proximal to the _cervical os_ is nutrient-poor
		- If the blastocyst implants into this area, there is a risk of [[placenta previa]]
2. Several primordial structures form
	- [[embryoblast]] forms [[bilaminar germ disc]]
	- [[trophoblast]] forms [[chorionic cavity]]
	- [[trophoblast]] mediates formation of **pockets of maternal blood** near the implanted embryo
