# Blastulation

## Steps in Blastulation
1. **Day 0**: Fertilization
	- Fusion of [[sperm]] and [[oocyte]]
	- Occurs in ampulla of [[Fallopian tube]]
2. **Day 0-5**: Formation of blastocyst
	- Rapid cleavage to form a [[blastocyst]]
3. **Day 5-7**: Beginning of implantation
	- The [[zona pellucida]] degrades and the blastocyst bursts free ("hatching")
		- If the blastocyst fails to burst from the zona pellucida, the trophoblast is unable to implant
	- [[Implantation]] occurs
