# [[proj_immunogenic-chemo|Ox/Cy]] Project 5

**Objective:** To explore effects of single-dose immunogenic chemotherapy on KP allograft model of lung cancer.

## Reagents/Samples
- [x] 25 mice
- [x] Antibody stocks for both flow panels
- [ ] KP cells in culture for at least 2 passages

## Procedure
1. T=0 days: Create flank tumors of 500k KP cells/tumor. Grow for 14 days.
	* [[ref_mouse_kp-line]]
	* [[sop_mouse_flank-injection]]

2. T+14: Divide mice into groups based on gross tumor size by calipers:
	* n=10 Oxaliplatin 2.5 mg/kg 
		* n=5 T-72 hours
		* T-24 hours
	* n=10 Cyclophosphamide 5.0 mg/kg 
		* n=5 T-72 hours
		* n=5 T-24 hours
	* n=5 controls/unmanipulated

3. T+14: Treat 72-hour mice with chemotherapy
   
4. T+16: Treat 24-hours mice with chemotherapy
   
5. T+17: Harvest mice.
	- IHC
	- Snap-frozen
	- Remainder to flow

6. Stain according to lymphoid and myeloid panels. Include:
	* Unstained pooled control
	* Spleen
	* [[sop_facs-staining]]

7. Either fix or run samples fresh. Need at least 2.5 hour reservation
	- [[sop_facs-diva-setup]]

## Notes
- MHC II on the myeloid panel has accidentally been moved from **BUV395** to **BV786**.
