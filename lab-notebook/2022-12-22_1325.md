# Lab Notebook 12/22

## Ox Cy Study
- Current cohort of mice looks like garbage
- Scheduling two additional PL cohorts ("A" and "B") to be scanned
	- Currently at 23.9 and 22 weeks post-cre respectively
- Experimental groups
	- Untreated
	- Oxaliplatin, analyzed 1 day after study termination
	- Oxaliplatin, analyzed 3 days after study termination

## Imaging Requests
* 2 groups of PL

## Cre
* New batch of PL mice ready; split into "A" and "B"

## Colony Management
- B6
- K.B6 
	- Needs more breeders (currently 2)
	- 4 cages past Cre age
	- Talk to McGarry about ramping
	- **Anything above 12 weeks gets culled**
- MMP8
	- Genotype new parent litters as they come
- MMP9
	- 1x old breeder
- MMP9.NE
	- 1x old breeder
- CG
- NE.CG
	- 1x old breeder
- NE.PR3
	- Set up new breeders **next week** #task
- NE.PR3.MMP9
- NE.CG.PR3
* NE
	* 1x old breeder
* PTEN.LKB1
	* Get imaging paperwork done for 2 groups
* Rb.p53
	* Set up new breeders **next week** #task 
* ANXA2
	* 1x old breeder
	* Ask Mark what he wants to do with the ANXA2 mice as they're taking up space in 233
* OT-1
	* Set up time to genotype in **~3 weeks** #task 

## Smoking Cell Culture
- Fibroblasts are persistent
- Adapting to DMEM/10

## Other Projects
* Lampe flanks H82 Friday
