# Digesting a spleen for lymphocytes
_Houghton lab protocol_
1. Dissect the spleen from a mouse.
2. Hold spleen in PBS or RPMI until ready to use
3. Using the plunger of a 1mL syringe, mash the spleen directly through a 70-micron strainer
   or
   Mash the spleen between the frosted sides of two microscope slides. Wash with FA-3 through a strainer.
4. Spin cells down, 400g x 3 min.
5. Lyse with ACK buffer, on ice, for 2-3 minutes. Strain through a 40-micron strainer.
6. Spin cells down.

## Modification: digesting a spleen for dendritic cells
_Dendritic cells are known to be sticky and can get caught in cell strainers if the tissue is not digested first._
