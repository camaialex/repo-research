# NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells)

_From Wikipedia_

Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) is a family of transcription factors shown to be important in immune response. One or more members of the NFAT family is expressed in most cells of the immune system. NFAT is also involved in the development of cardiac, skeletal muscle, and nervous systems. NFAT was first discovered as an activator for the transcription of IL-2 in T cells (as a regulator of T cell immune response) but has since been found to play an important role in regulating many more body systems. NFAT transcription factors are involved in many normal body processes as well as in development of several diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and several types of cancer. NFAT is also being investigated as a drug target for several different disorders.

Calcium signalling is critical to activation of NFATc1-4 because calmodulin (CaM), a well-known calcium sensor protein, activates the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (CN). Activated CN binds to its binding site located in the N-terminal regulatory domain of NFATc1-4 and rapidly dephosphorylates the serine-rich region (SRR) and SP-repeats which are also present in the N-terminus of the NFAT proteins. This dephosphorylation results in a conformational change that exposes a nuclear localization signal which promotes nuclear translocation.
