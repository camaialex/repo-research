# [[overview_project01|Ox/Cy]] Project 5

**Objective:** To explore effects of multi-dose single-agent chemotherapy on PL GEM mice

## Experimental Design
Mice
	- [[genotype_PTEN.LKB1]] (floxxed)

Groups
	- n = 15
		- **Group 1:** n = 5 full study, harvested T+1 day after study end
		- **Group 2:** n = 5 full study, harvested T+3 day after study end
		- **Group 3:** n = 5 untreated, harvested T+3 day after study end

Agents (each to be tested individually)
	- Oxaliplatin
	- Cyclophosphamide (low-dose)
	- Cyclophosphamide (high-dose)
	- Mitoxantrone
	- Busulfan

## Procedure
1. [ ] Randomize mice into groups based on tumor size at initial CT
2. [ ] Re-scan mice T-1 day before study initiation
3. [ ] T=0 Inject mice with agent #todo dosages pending
4. [ ] T+7 Inject mice with agent #todo dosages pending
5. [ ] T+14 Inject mice with agent #todo dosages pending
6. [ ] T+15 Harvest Group 1
7. [ ] Flow Group 1
8. [ ] T+17 Harvest Group 2
9. [ ] Flow Group 2
