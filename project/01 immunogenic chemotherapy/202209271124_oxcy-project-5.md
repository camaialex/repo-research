# [[overview_project01|Ox/Cy]] Project 5

**Objective:** To explore effects of single-dose immunogenic chemotherapy on KP allograft model of lung cancer.

## To do
- [x] 25 mice
- [x] Antibody stocks for both flow panels
- [x] KP cells in culture for at least 2 passages
- [ ] Flank-inject mice
- [ ] Harvest and run flow

## Procedure
1. T=0 days: Create flank tumors of 500k KP cells/tumor. Grow for 14 days.
	* [[culture_kp]]
	* [[sop_mouse_flank-injection]]

2. T+14: Divide mice into groups based on gross tumor size by calipers:
	* n=10 Oxaliplatin 2.5 mg/kg 
		* n=5 T-72 hours
		* T-24 hours
	* n=10 Cyclophosphamide 5.0 mg/kg 
		* n=5 T-72 hours
		* n=5 T-24 hours
	* n=5 controls/unmanipulated

3. T+14: Treat 72-hour mice with chemotherapy
	- [[sop_ip-injection]]
   
4. T+16: Treat 24-hour mice with chemotherapy
	- [[sop_ip-injection]]
   
5. T+17: Harvest mice. Devote the entire tumor to flow.
	* [[sop_flow]]

6. Stain according to [[panel_murine-hybrid-survey-01]]. Include:
	* Unstained pooled control
	* Spleen from each group
	* [[sop_flow]]

7. Either fix or run samples fresh. Need at least 2.5 hour reservation
