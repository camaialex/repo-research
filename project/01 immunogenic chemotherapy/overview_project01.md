Working title:
# Immunogenic chemotherapy to activate host immune response to lung cancer

(Otherwise known as the #oxcy project)

## Conceptual Summary
Immunotherapy has revolutionized the way we treat cancer. However, only ~18% of patients respond to immunotherapy.

**We hypothesize** that certain doses and combinations of chemotherapy when used with immunotherapy will generate robust immune responses in immunotherapy-resistant lung cancer.

**We hypothesize** that chemotherapy makes tumors vulnerable to antigen recognition and T-cell infiltration through a phenomenon called "immunogenicity."

## Specific Aims
### Aim 1: Combination chemotherapy-immunotherapy reduces tumor burden in mouse models of lung cancer


## Progress Summary
1. Project 1: Pilot Study in LLC flank
2. Project 2: Pilot Study in KP flank
3. Project 3: Investigating effects of single-dose chemo
4. [[202209271048_oxcy-project-4|Project 4]]: Optimization of mouse flow panel
5. [[202209271124_oxcy-project-5|Project 5]]: Investigating effects of single-dose chemo
