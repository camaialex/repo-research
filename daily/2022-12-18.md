# The transcription factor IRF2 drives interferon-mediated CD8+ T cell exhaustion to restrict anti-tumor immunity


## Summary
- Cytokines drive both immune-stimulatory and immune-suppressive mechanisms
	- How are these systems controlled?
- IRF2 (interferon regulatory factor 2) is induced in response to interferons and contributes to induction of T-cell exhaustion programs within the tumor
