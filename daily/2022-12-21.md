# Profound phenotypic and epigenetic heterogeneity of the HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cell reservoir

## Summary
- One of the primary obstacles in finding a cure for HIV is understanding the HIV-infected immune cell "HIV reservoir"
- Characterized epigenetic diversity of HIV reservoir
- Discovered signature suggesting infected cells are poised for reactivation following [[ref_art|ART]] therapy
- Establishment of **multiomic atlas** of immune heterogeneity in HIV reservoir

## Innovative Methods Used
- Single-cell profiling utilizing integrated viral DNA + epigenetic + cell surface phenotyping 

## Major findings and relevance
-
