# Dendritic cells direct circadian anti-tumor immune responses

## Summary
- The time of day a tumor is engrafted onto a mouse dictates its growth dynamics
- Circadian immune rhythms:
	- Circadian homing of DCs to draining lymph nodes
	- Dependence on circadian marker CD80

## Innovative Methods Used
- Using mice deficient for certain circadian functions

## Major findings and relevance
- Bruh...have we been doing flanks wrong
