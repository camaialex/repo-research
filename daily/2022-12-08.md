# Early microbial exposure shapes adult immunity by altering CD8+ T cell development

## Summary
- Microbial exposure/colonization during early development results in altered T-cell development that leads to effective immunity

## Innovative Methods Used
- 

## Major findings and relevance
-  Mechanism: Microbial exposure results in altered epigenetic program which selects for highly responsive fetal-derived CD8+ cells that persist in the immune system during and after development
