# Advancing beyond the twists and turns of [[cell_t-cell|T cell]] exhaustion in cancer

## Summary
- T-cell exhaustion is an evolutionary adaptation that allows T-cell survival in the context of continuous antigen exposure while maintaining some effector function
- This exhaustion program becomes harder and harder to reverse as time goes on
- Critical to characterize heterogeneity in **timecourse** of T-cell differentiation in exhaustion-related pathology

## Innovative Methods Used
- 

## Major findings and relevance
- Progenitor exhausted T-cells ([[cell-progenitor-exhausted-t|Tpex]])
