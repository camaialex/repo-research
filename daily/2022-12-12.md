# Aging-associated HELIOS deficiency in naive CD4+ T cells alters chromatin remodeling and promotes effector cell responses

## Summary
- Naive CD4+ T-cells lose expression of epigenetic modifier HELIOS with increasing patient age, favoring effector differentiation and tissue infiltration/inflammation.

## Innovative Methods Used
- 

## Major findings and relevance
-
