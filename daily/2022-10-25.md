# McGarry 1:1 Meeting Agenda

This meeting was originally supposed to be for going through the smoking mice, but other pressing issues are represented as well.

### Administrative
- Replacement for Surapat?
- Who should we move to Surapat's desk
- Lab meeting agenda after shuffling

### Smoking Mice
- Need to classify mice as RD, PD, or SD (RECIST criteria)
	- Begin with cohort 1

### Chemotherapy Study
- Going to pick up the drugs today
- Need more time to select a cohort of mice + take baseline CT
