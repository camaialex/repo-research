### Learning Objectives
- Recognize the five overarching concepts (protect, detect/recognize, deploy, eliminate or tolerate, and remember) that provide the structural framework for the function of the immune system.
	- Protect
		- Involving barrier organs like skin and stomach. Prevent microbes from getting in in the first place
	- Detect/recognize
		- Dendritic cells, other APCs. Bind antigen to recognize microbe and trigger immune response
	- Deploy
		- (Clonal) expansion of cells
	- Eliminate
		- Phagocytosis, antibody-mediated elimination, cytotoxic killing
	- Tolerate
		- Tregs; recognize self-antigens and prevent immune response against them
	- Remember
		- Plasma cells: Store record of a pathogen that was fought off to facilitate secondary immune response
- Differentiate between the features and functions of the innate and adaptive immune system.
	- Innate immune system
		- Prevents pathogens from getting in (barrier organs)
		- Recognizes patterns that signal danger (TLRs)
		- Engage phagocytosis
		- First line of defense
		- Responds generally and nonspecifically
		- Engages innate immune system through antigen presentation
	- Adaptive immune system
		- Responds highly-specifically (antigen-specific)
		- Requires stimulation by an APC
		- Involves humoral (antibody) and cell-mediated immunity
			- Involves B and T-cells
		- Immunological memory allows more effective response to a second insult

### Text Summary

A successful immune response depends on finely choreographed interactions among diverse cell types that together patrol and defend the body. Innate immune cells mount the first line of defense. Antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, communicate the invader (pathogen) to the lymphoid T and B cells, which coordinate an adaptive response and generate memory cells that prevent future infections. The coordination required for a full immune response is made possible by the specialized anatomy and microanatomy of the immune system, which is dispersed throughout the body and organizes cells in space and time. The **primary lymphoid organs, such as bone marrow and thymus, are sites where immune cells develop** from immature precursors. The **secondary lymphoid organs, such as spleen, lymph nodes, and specialized sites in the gut and mucosal tissues, are sites where mature, antigen-specific lymphocytes first encounter antigen** and begin their differentiation into effector and memory cells. There are two circulatory systems, the blood and lymph, that connect these organs, uniting them into a functional whole.

### Notes
- Compartments of immune system
	- Innate
		- Response generally and the same way each time
		- No memory, does not change or adapt
	- Adaptive
		- Learns and develops "memory"
		- Communication via cytokines
- Complement: "Landmines"
	- Waits until a pathogen activates the system
		- Forms Membrane Attack Complex that disrupts the bacterial barrier
		- Opsonizes encapsulated bacteria
	- Pathology: with no complement, suffer severe infections from encapsulated bacterias
- Phagocytes: "Marines"
	- First cells to be deployed
	- Patrols blood and infiltrates tissues
	- Phagocytose pathogens and present antigen
	- MHCI
	- Pathology: missing phagocytes, develop skin and soft-tissue infections and poor wound-healing
- B-cells: "Air Force"
	- Smart-bomb antibodies/immunoglobulins
	- Pathology: Recurrent bacterial **sinopulmonary** infections (sinusitis, ear infection, bronchitis, pneumonia)
- T-cells: "Generals/assassins/psychologists"
	- CD4+: "Generals" that direct immune responses (B-cells)
	- CD8+: "Assassinate" host cells that are infected
	- Tregs: "Psychologists" that regulate activated cells after an infection to prevent autoimmunity
	- Pathology: Dysfunctional T-cells, cannot generate antibody response, several viral/fungal infection, severe autoimmunity
- Protect
- Detect/recognize
- Deploy
- Eliminate/Tolerate
- Remember
