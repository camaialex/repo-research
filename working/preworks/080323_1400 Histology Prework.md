### Notes
- Types of epithelial tissues
	- Simple vs stratified (1 vs 2+ layers)
		- Pseudostratified: Simple epithelium that contains diverse cell types that gives illusion of layers
			- When classifying, we go with "**pseudostratified COLUMNAR**"
	- Shape of **apical** cells
		- Squamous (flat)
			- Keratinized vs. nonkeratinized
			- Simple squamous epithelia are typically nonkeratinized
		- Cuboidal
		- Columnar
			- Ciliated vs. nonciliated
	- Transitional epithelium
		- Typically **stratified** with cuboidal apical layer
		- BUT when stretched, cells can take a different shape ranging all the way to squamous
		- Ex. lining urinary tract which is designed to distend and recoil
- How to name:
	- **Layers + Cell type + specialization + tissue**
- Organ-specific epithelia
	- Mesothelium: epithelial lining of all viscera/internal body cavities/viscera
		- **Simple squamous**
	- Endothelium: lining of lumen of vasculature
		- **Simple squamous**
	- Urothelium: lining of the urinary tract 
		- **Transitional**
	- Respiratory epithelium
		- **Pseudostratified columnar ciliated**

### Study Guide
- Once you have located an epithelial tissue, what morphological features should you look for in order to classify it?
	- Number of cell layers
	- Shape of apical layer
	- Specializations
- Recall and diagram below the epithelial tissue classification formula (try without looking at the video), including the “odd ones out” and the organ specific names for certain epithelia
	- Number of cell layers
		- 1: Simple
		- +1: Stratified
	- Shape of cells
		- Squamous
		- Cuboidal
		- Columnar
	- Specializations
		- **Squamous** can be keratinized or nonkeratinized
		- **Columnar** can be ciliated or nonciliated
	- Odd ones out
		- **Pseudostratified** epithelia are simple epithelia made of diverse cell types that give the illusion of multiple layers
		- **Transitional** epithelia are epithelia that create different shapes when stretched and rebounded. Typically cuboidal.
		- **Mesothelium** lines the viscera and internal organs (simple squamous)
		- **Endothelium** lines the vasculature (simple squamous)
		- **Urogenital epithelium** lines the urogenital tract (transitional)
		- **Respiratory epithelium** lines the respiratory tract (pseudostratified columnar ciliated)
