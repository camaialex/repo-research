### Notes
- Primary lymphoid organs: **Early development**
	- Bone marrow
	- Thymus
- Secondary lymphoid organs: **Maturation, interaction, generation of 2ry immune response**
	- Spleen
	- Lymphatic vessels
	- Lymph nodes
	- Tonsils/adenoids
	- Mucosa-associated lymphatic tissues
- Hematopoiesis
	- Common progenitor
		- Lymphoid lineage
		- Myeloid lineage
	- Primarily happens in the bone marrow
- Thymus
	- T-cell maturation
		- Generation of immune tolerance
- Lymph
	- Interstitial fluid: fluid that leaves vascular (blood) and bathes tissues. Like lower-protein plasma
	- Chyle: Chylomicrons absorbed from gut
	- Leukocytes
- Spleen
	- B-cell maturation
	- "White pulp": lymphoid cell interactions
	- "Red pulp": filters blood of damaged cells, pathogens and debris
- Lymphatic vessels
	- **Blind-ended**(???) capillaries
	- Collect interstitial fluid and immune cells
	- Valves to prevent backflow
	- Pathway: (lymphatic) capillaries -> collecting vessels -> right duct -> thoracic duct
- Lymph nodes
	- Follicles
		- B-cell zone and T-cell zone
	- Major site of APC antigen presentation and T-cell mediated B-cell class-switching
- Tonsils and adenoids
	- Rear of oropharynx and nasopharynx respectively
	- Part of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue system
	- Similarly structured to lymph nodes (follicles and germinal centers)
	- Waldeyer's ring
	- Samples antigens that come into mouth and nose
- MALT
	- Lymphoid aggregates along mucosa (follicles)
	- Defense at sites of recurrent exposure (ex. food)
