### Learning Objectives
- Describe the process of gastrulation including its timeline, the structures and new cell populations that form, and their derivative organ systems. 
	- Begins as bilaminar germ disc
	- Formation of primitive streak
	- EMT of primitive streak cells to form mesoderm
		- Formation of paraxial, intermediate, and lateral plate mesoderm
	- Now known as trilaminar germ disc
- Describe the process of neurulation including its timeline, the structures and new cell populations that form, and their derivatives.
	- Raising of ectoderm and invagination of neuroectoderm
	- Creates
		- Neural tube
		- Neural crest cells
	- Zipping up and down the embryo

Define the following:
- Dorsal
	- Towards the back
- Ventral
	- Towards the stomach
- Cranial/Rostral
	- Towards the head/nose
- Caudal
	- Towards the feet/tail
- Conceptus **
	- General term for a product of fertilization (zygote, embryo, fetus, plus all the extraembryonic structures, such as placenta, membranes, etc)
- Intraembryonic
	- Tissues and cells that give rise to the embryo
- Extraembryonic
	- Tissues and cells that give rise to structures outside the embryo, **including**:
		- (Fetal) Placenta
		- Umbilical cord
		- Membranes
- Embryonic stage of development
	- Period between 0 and 8 weeks
- Fetal stage of development
	- Period between 9 weeks and term
- Mesenchyme **
	- Loose embryonic connective tissue

### Notes
1. OP -> ventral and caudally
2. CL membrane  -> ventral and cranially
3. Primitive streak begins to regress
4. PM -> somites (???)
5. LPM splits into ventral and lateral sheets
	1. Folding ventrally
6. Embryonic membrane expansion
7. Yolk sac begins to form gut
8. Amniotic membrane surrounds embryo
9.  IM forming urogenital ridge
10. LPM forming body wall, heart tube
11. Amnion completely surrounds
