### Learning Objectives
- Define the anatomic terminology used to describe relationships between structures in the body (i.e., anterior, posterior, dorsal, ventral, medial, lateral, proximal, distal, cranial/rostral, caudal)
	- Anterior
		- Towards the front
	- Posterior
		- Towards the rear
	- Dorsal
		- Towards the back
	- Ventral
		- Towards the stomach (front)
	- Medial
		- Towards the midline
	- Lateral
		- Away from the midline
	- Proximal
		- Near; often in reference to the trunk of the body
	- Distal
		- Far from; often in reference to the trunk of the body

The anatomical position: the standard position of the body when discussing anatomy

Define the following:
- Superior
	- Above; moving up the vertical axis (cranial)
- Inferior
	- Below; moving down the vertical axis (caudal)
- Cranial
	- Towards the head
- Caudal
	- Towards the tail
- Proximal
	- Near a point of reference (often the trunk)
- Distal
	- Far from a point of reference (often the trunk)
- Lateral
	- Away from the midline
- Medial
	- Near the midline
- Plantar
	- In reference to the soles of the feet
- Palmar
	- In reference to the palms
- Dorsum
	- In reference to the back of the hand or top of the foot
- Sagittal
	- Plane dividing the left and right sides of the body
- Median sagittal
	- Sagittal plane drawn perfectly down the line of symmetry in the body
- Coronal
	- Plane dividing dorsal and ventral sides of the body
- Frontal
	- Another name for coronal plane
- Transverse
	- Another name for axial plane
- Horizontal
	- Another name for axial plane
- Axial
	- Plane dividing cranial and caudal sections of the body
