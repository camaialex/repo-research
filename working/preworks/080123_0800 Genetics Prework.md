### Learning Objectives
- Define single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). 
- Describe how nondisjunction leads to aneuploidy. 
- Describe various inheritance patterns, including autosomal dominant and recessive, X-linked, imprinting, mitochondrial, and anticipation.

### Reviewing Modes of Inheritance
- Mendelian
	- Autosomal dominant
		- 50% risk if one parent is affected
		- No sex bias
		- Does not skip generations
		- Affected individuals typically have affected parents
			- Ex. de novo, penetrance or expressivity issue
	- Autosomal recessive
		- 25% risk if parents are carriers
		- No sex bias
		- Often skips generations
		- Unaffected individuals can be "carriers"
		- Risk increases with inbreeding (consanguinity)
	- X-linked
		- Females can be "carriers" of the condition if the condition is recessive
		- Females can be affective if the condition is dominant
			- Exception: skewed X-inactivation
		- Males cannot pass disorder to sons
		- Daughters of affected fathers will carry disease allele
		- Sometimes is lethal in males, so only females seem to be affected
- Non-Mendelian
	- Epigenetics and imprinting disorders
		- Imprinting: expression of only one of two alleles of some genes
			- Happens naturally during development
			- Reset during gametogenesis and proceeds uniquely in offspring
		- Parent of origin (???) determines whether individual is affected
	- Mitochondrial
		- Maternal inheritance
		- Heteroplasmy possible
			- Each mitochondrion carries multiple copies of mtDNA
			- Random mitochondria are passed down from mother
			- Heteroplasmy: presence of different mtDNA variants in same cell

### Mechanisms of Action of Genetic Pathologies
- LOF
	- Amorphic: No function
	- Hypomorphic: Less function
	- Most recessive conditions
		- Dominant conditions in cases of haploinsufficiency
- GOF
	- Hypermorphic: More function
	- Some dominant conditions
- Dominant negative
	- Antimorphic: interferes with any normal alleles
	- Common with proteins that polymerize
		- If one subunit doesn't work, often the entire thing breaks
	- Usually a missense mutation

### Somatic Mutations
- Mutations that are not inherited (occur after conception)
	- Mosaicism
- Example: PIK3CA
	- Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
	- Mutations are seen in many cancers and overgrowths

### Mutation Timing
- Germline: occurs at fertilization
- Somatic mosaicism: occurs in a somatic cell in the body
- Gonadal mosaicism: occurs in a germ cell in the body

### Small-Scale Mutations
- SNPs
	- Missense
		- Conservative
		- Non-conservative
	- Nonsense
	- Silent
- Deletion/insertion
	- Frameshift
	- Non-frameshift
- Trinucleotide repeats
	- Premutation: repeats don't cause disorder
	- Full mutation
	- Anticipation: increasing # of repeats per generation builds up to disorder
	- Risk depends of parent of origin

### Crossing Over
- Non-allelic homologous recombination between low copy repeats
	- Causes deletion and/or addition of sections

## Worksheet
- [ ] Checked?
1.  A mutation can be
	- Large-scale
		- Such as
			- Duplication
			- Inversion
			- Deletion
			- Translocation
		- And can be tested by
			- Balanced: chromosomal microarray
			- Unbalanced: karyotype
	- **Small-scale**
		- Such as
			- Missense
			- Nonsense
		- And can be tested by
			- NGS
2. Theoretical gene MET
	1. SNPs in the promoter can affect gene function by:
		1. Decreasing the function of the promoter, causing decreased transcription
		2. Increasing the function of the promoter, causing increased transcription
		3. Negating the function of the promoter, halting all transcription
	2. This is an epigenetic mutation. It may occur through imprinting or mutations in methyltransferase genes elsewhere in the genome. It could mimic the phenotype of a mutated MET gene if it slows or halts transcription of MET, resulting in a phenotype that resembles a LOF mutation.
	3. Alternative splicing can create different isoforms of the gene based on the tissue it is transcribed in. Exon 3 may be included only in transcripts produced in hepatocytes, while Exon 5 is always included.
	4. The kinase may affect upstream gene regulation that ultimately impacts the transcription of the MET gene.
		1. **Answer key: The kinase could affect PTM of the MET gene product**
3. NDJ leading to Down Syndrome**
	1. Down Syndrome is also known as Trisomy 21
	2. NDJ during Anaphase II creates a gamete with two copies of chromosome 21
	3. **Answer key: NDJ during anaphase I can cause a trisomy as well**
	4. When combined with another normal gamete, it creates a trisomy
4. Affected male and unaffected female (not carrier)
	1. Autosomal dominant: All your children will be affected
		1. **Answer key: 50%**
	2. Autosomal recessive: All your children will be carriers
	3. X-linked dominant: All your daughters will be carriers
	4. Paternal imprinting disorder, deletion in maternal copy: Children at risk
		1. **Answer key: 50% chance to pass maternal copy (children unaffected), 50% chance a daughter will pass it on to their child who will be affected 
	5. Mitochondrial: No risk
5. Huntington disease
	1. This pedigree shows anticipation (building up of copy numbers that exacerbate disease onset)
