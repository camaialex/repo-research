### Learning Objectives
- Explain log dose-response curves and their use to compare potency and efficacy of different drugs; explain: potency (affinity/Kd/EC50), efficacy (power/Emax), and agonist - partial agonist - antagonist.
	- Potency is formally defined as ED50, the minimum dose of a drug required to achieve 50% clinical efficacy. More potent drugs have smaller ED50 and their dose-response curve is shifted leftward.
	- Efficacy is formally defined as the Emax, the minimum dose of a drug required to achieve maximum clinical effect. More effective/powerful drugs have a "taller" dose-response curve.
	- Agonists act on a receptor to trigger a desired signaling cascade.
	- Partial agonists act on a receptor to trigger a similar but weaker signaling cascade compared to the endogenous molecule.
	- Antagonists act via various mechanisms to counteract a target signaling cascade, either by directly occupying the receptor or indirectly preventing the signaling cascade's effects.
- Distinguish between characteristics of the different types of antagonism (pharmacological [competitive reversible and noncompetitive irreversible], physiological, chemical) and provide examples.
	- Pharmacological: antagonist acts directly on the receptor in question
		- Competitive reversible: antagonist binds directly and reversibly to the receptor
			- Ex. Metoprolol
		- Noncompetitive irreversible: antagonist binds to an allosteric site covalently to permanently change the conformation of the receptor, preventing molecules from binding to it. Ex. Erythromycin
	- Physiological: Antagonist engages a different receptor to counteract the receptor signaling cascade in question. Example: epinephrine
	- Chemical: Antagonist acts through a mechanism other than a receptor. Example: EDTA
- Compare graded dose-response curves to population dose-response curves and explain the use of population dose-response curves to evaluate drug safety (Therapeutic Index and Standard Safety Margin).
	- Graded dose response curves are rectangular hyperbolas that demonstrate the relationship between the dosage of a drug and the magnitude of clinical effect.
	- Quantal dose response curves are generated by designating a "response" threshold and plotting dose of drug against the **% of individuals who meet response threshold** on the y axis rather than the magnitude of response.
	- Therapeutic index is the ratio of LD50 to ED50. The higher this number is, the safer the drug is.
	- SSM: Zone between **surely effective dose** (ED99) and lowest lethal dose (LD1). Expressed as ratio between LD1 and ED99. The higher the number (???) the better.

- Pharmacodynamics
	- Study of the physiological and biochemical effects of drugs
	- **What drugs do to the body**
- Pharmacokinetics
	- Study of the movement of drugs within the body
	- **What the body does to drugs**
- Agonists (Direct vs. Indirect): Drugs that activate a target (effectors)
	- Direct: Binding directly to receptor to trigger signaling cascade (mimic endogenous)
	- Indirect: Enhance the action of endogenous molecule (ex. by increasing release)
- Antagonists (Competitive vs. Non-competitive): Drugs that inhibit a target (inhibitors)
	- Competitive: Directly occlude binding site of endogenous
	- Non-competitive: Bind away from binding site (ex. allosteric) which changes the conformation of the binding site
- Functional antagonists
	- Antagonists who act as agonists for a process that counteracts another process
	- Also called "physiological antagonists"
- Chemical antagonist
	- Antagonist that doesn't target a receptor
	- As opposed to a **pharmacologic** antagonist which targets the intended receptor
- Partial agonist
	- Generates a similar but weaker signal
	- As opposed to a **full agonist**
- Efficacy
	- **Maximum effect a drug is capable of producing**
	- Most effective determinant of clinical effect
	- Relationship between receptor binding and intended signaling effect
	- "Effect" refers to **clinical effect** and not necessarily effect at a specific molecular target (ex. pain relief, not blocking of specific receptor)
		- Can be compared between drugs with different mech. of action
- Effective dose
	- Minimal drug dose to achieve maximum efficacy
- ED50
	- **Minimal drug dose to achieve 50% maximum efficacy**
	- Also known as potency
	- Dependent on affinity (Kd) of drug for receptora
	- Only has relevance in dosing, no real clinical relevance
	- Often expressed as dosage to achieve clinical effect
- Toxicity
	- Negative physiological consequences (unintended) as a result of taking a drug
- LD50
	- Minimal drug dose that is lethal in 50% of subjects
- Therapeutic index
	- Ratio of LD50 to ED50
	- Higher = safer
- Drug receptor theory
	- All pharmacology hinges on the interaction between a drug and its cognate receptor
	- Assumes reversible binding and simple mass-action principles

### Quiz
1. ED50 describes the potency of the drug.
2. Drug A is most potent.
3. ED50(X) < ED50(Y), therefore Drug Y is less potent than Drug X. Drug Y is also less powerful than Drug X.
4. Ketorolac is more potent than ibuprofen.
5. Naloxone is a competitive antagonist.
6. A reversible competitive antagonist causes the ED50 to increase
7. An irreversible noncompetitive antagonist causes the Emax to decrease
8. Pharmacologic antagonism
