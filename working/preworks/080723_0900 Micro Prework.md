- Identify the different interplays between humans and micro-organisms
	- Micro-organisms become normal parts of our microbiota through _colonization_
	- Micro-organisms can also become _pathogenic_ if they spread systemically or in an immunocompromised host
- Describe the key mechanisms of transmission of infection
	- Human-human
		- Respiratory
		- Oral/fecal
		- Blood transmission
		- Sexual transmission
	- Zoonoses
- Describe a generalized viral life cycle for each of the different groups of viruses (i.e. the Baltimore classification scheme.
	- The central molecule for all classes of viruses is _mRNA_.
	- Common to all viruses
		- Binding to host membrane
		- Endocytosis
		- Release of genetic material
		- Co-opting host translation machinery to manufacture viral particles
		- Assembly of viral particles in the cytosol
		- Exit of host membrane
	- RNA viruses
		- Encode their own mRNA for reverse transcriptase
	- DNA viruses
		- Rely entirely on host transcriptional machinery
- Identify the distinctive structures of a virus and describe their functions in viral life cycles
	- Capsule: Protective layer found on some viruses
	- Capsid: Protein coat (can be rod, icosahedral, complex) that protects the virus genome
	- Viral genome
	- Glycoproteins: Proteins attached to the capsid that mediate host membrane binding
- Describe key structural and functional features unique to bacteria
	- Peptidoglycan cell wall: protects bacterial cell
	- Capsule: assists in immune evasion
	- Membrane projections
		- Pili: small filaments that mediate host membrane binding
		- Flagellum: Large projection assisting in motility
		- Cilia: Small projections assisting in motility
	- Plasmid: non-genomic DNA that helps with survival ex. antibiotic resistance
- Explain how horizontal gene transfer relates to virulence and antimicrobial resistance.
	- Horizontal gene transfer allows a bacterium who has resistance to antibiotics to transfer resistance to nearby bacteria
- Explain how the bacterial cell wall is involved in identification and classification of bacteria and as a target for antibiotics.
	- Gram staining targets the peptidoglycan cell wall
	- Gram-positive bacteria have only a thick cell wall on the exterior, staining strongly
	- Gram-negative bacteria have an outer capsule composed partly of lipopolysaccharide and a thin peptidoglycan cell wall, and do not stain
- Describe common tests used to identify pathogens
	- Gram staining: used to identify Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
	- Culture: used to identify species of bacteria as well as possible antibiotic resistances
	- PCR test: used to amplify regions of genome specific to certain pathogen species
	- Antigen test: detects pathogen-specific epitopes
	- Antibody test: detects host response to a pathogen
- Discuss the limitations of different testing modalities
	- Gram staining: not specific to species of bacteria or antibiotic resistance
	- Culture: takes time, some bacteria cannot be cultured
	- PCR test: ?
	- Antigen test: Relies on a specific antigen?
	- Antibody: not possible in immunocompromised patients, lags behind actual disease stage (possible for false negatives during initial stages of infection)
	- **The presence of a pathogen does not automatically imply an infection is occurring**
- Describe the basic structural features of yeasts, molds, and dimorphic fungi
	- Yeasts: predominantly capsule-shaped, can form pseudohyphae
	- Molds: grow in hyphae (filamentous networks) often punctuated by perforated septae; form fruiting bodies when not inside a host
	- Dimorphic fungi: take the form of yeast (high temp) or mold (low temp) dependent on temperature
- Describe the pathogenesis of fungal invasion
	- Fungus invades a mucosal tissue
	- Fungus proliferates within host cell
	- Fungus digests host cell from inside and bursts free, causing damage to the mucosal barrier
	- Fungus proliferates deeper into connective tissue
	- If fungus encounters vasculature, it can breach and colonize the blood vessel
	- Pieces of the hyphae network can break off and spread through the blood, colonizing other tissues
- Explain how the host immune status affects susceptibility to fungal infections
	- Immunocompromised hosts are unable to recognize and clear fungal infections, and fungi which normally only cause superficial infections in most people can lead to life-threatening systemic infection in these individuals
