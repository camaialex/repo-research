### Learning Objectives
- Recall the classification schema and terminologies referring to the number of cell layers and apical cell morphology to classify epithelial tissues.
	- Cell morphology: Squamous (flat) cuboidal (square), columnar (tall)
	- Layers: Simple (1 layer), stratified (2+ layers), pseudostratified (uneven single layer)
- Compare the composition, general functions, and locations of the four basic tissue types in the body.â€¯
	- Epithelial: Cell-rich, ECM-poor; serve as barrier, control passage of materials in and out, secretory functions
	- Muscle: Cell-rich, ECM-mid; specialized contractile cells help with motility
	- Neural: rich in ground substance and specialized neurons/glial cells that form the body's nervous system
	- (???) Connective tissue: Cell-poor, ECM-rich, rich in diffuse reticular fibers that allow cells to aggregate and form tissue structures
- Summarize the major organelles typically found in a eukaryotic cell.
	- Nucleus: DNA replication and repair, rRNA synthesis, transcription
	- RER: studded with ribosomes, secretory, membrane-bound, N-glycosylation
	- SER: no ribosomes, lipid/steroid synthesis and detoxification
	- Golgi body: protein packaging and distribution center
	- Mitochondria: :)
	- Lysosome: breakdown of cellular wastes
	- Proteasome: breakdown of proteins
	- Peroxisome: beta-oxidation and redox balance
	- Vesicles: transport proteins, other nutrients across cell

### Notes
- Morphology
	- Cuboidal
	- Discoid/biconcave
- ECM structures
	- Fibers
		- Collagen: long, thick, strong, resist stretching
		- Elastic: Spidery, long fibers, recoil back after stress
		- Reticular: short, form fine fishnet-like networks that cells can stick to
	- Ground substances
		- Carbohydrate-rich macromolecule anchors
			- Attract fluids
		- Glycosaminoglycans
		- Glycoproteins
		- Proteoglycans
	- Fluids
		- Similar to plasma
		- Mostly water
		- "Interstitial fluid"

### Notes
- Basic tissue types

	- Nucleus
	- ER
	- Nucleolus
- Exceptions
	- RBCs and platelets are anuclear

### Notes
- RER, SER, presence/absence of ribosomes
- RER: synthesis of membrane-bound, secretory proteins, N-linked oligosaccharide additions
- Secretory cells contain lots of ER (COMMON TEST QUESTION)
	- Goblet cells (mucus)
	- Plasma cells (antibodies)
- Nissl bodies: granular bodies of RER in neurons
	- Synthesize peptide neurotransmitters
- Cytoplasmic basophilia: High concentration of ribosomes in the RER which shows up as darker purple staining on H&E
- SER: lipid/steroid synthesis, detoxification
	- Hepatocytes (detox)
	- Adrenal cortex (steroid hormone synthesis)
- Golgi apparatus
	- Distribution of proteins via vesicles
	- Membrane-bound, secretory, within cell
- Mitochondria
	- Energy center
	- Cristae
	- OxPhos
	- Be careful: can see longitudinal or x-section view of a mitochondria cut
- Lysosomes
	- Cellular garbage disposal via hydrolytic enzymes
- Peroxisomes
	- Oxidative balance
	- Breakdown of large macromolecules
- Proteasome
