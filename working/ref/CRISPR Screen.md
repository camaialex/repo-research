# CRISPR Screen

A CRISPR screen is a large-scale method for finding candidate genes of interest.

A screen involves knocking out genes of interest in single cells (one gene knocked out per cell).

The population of cells change based on the changes in viability conferred by the knockout. Eventually, the genetic distribution of cells change. [[Next-generation sequencing]] can tell you which sequences are depleted.

Often, this is carried out under a specific **condition**, such as the presence of a drug (determining genes involved in drug resistance)
