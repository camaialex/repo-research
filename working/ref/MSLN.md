Mesothelin is a 40 kDa protein that is expressed in [[mesothelial cell]]s. The protein was first identified by its reactivity with monoclonal antibody K1. Subsequent cloning studies showed that the mesothelin gene encodes a precursor protein that is processed to yield mesothelin which is attached to the cell membrane by a [[GPI|glycophosphatidylinositol]] linkage and a 31-kDa shed fragment named megakaryocyte-potentiating factor (MPF). Although it has been proposed that mesothelin may be involved in cell adhesion, its biological function is not known. A knockout mouse line that lacks mesothelin reproduces and develops normally.

Mesothelin is over expressed in several human tumors, including mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. Mesothelin binds MUC16 (also known as CA125), indicating that the interaction of mesothelin and MUC16 may contribute to the implantation and peritoneal spread of tumors by cell adhesion. The region (residues 296-359) consisting of 64 amino acids at the N-terminus of cell surface mesothelin has been identified as the functional binding domain (named IAB) for MUC16/CA125, suggesting the mechanism of mesothelin acting as a MUC16/CA125 functional partner in cancer development.
