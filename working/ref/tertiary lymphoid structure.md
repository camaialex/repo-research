Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) are organized aggregates of immune cells that form postnatally in nonlymphoid tissues. TLSs are not found under physiological conditions but arise in the context of chronic inflammation, such as in autoimmune disease, chronic infection, and cancer. With few exceptions, the presence of TLSs in tumors correlates with better prognosis and clinical outcome upon immunotherapy, but, in spite of their presumed importance, the drivers of TLS formation in cancer and the contribution of these structures to intratumoral immune responses remain incompletely understood.
