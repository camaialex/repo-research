Ubiquitin specific peptidase 18 (USP18), also known as UBP43, is a type I interferon receptor repressor and an isopeptidase. In humans, it is encoded by the USP18 gene. USP18 is induced by the immune response to type I and III interferons, and serves as a negative regulator of type I interferon, but not type III interferon. Loss of USP18 results in increased responsiveness to type I interferons and life-threatening autoinflammatory disease in humans due to the negative regulatory function of USP18 in interferon signal transduction. Independent of this activity, USP18 is also a member of the deubiquitinating protease family of enzymes. It is known to remove ISG15 conjugates from a broad range of protein substrates, a process known as deISGylation.
