Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) also known as MUM1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the IRF4 gene, located at 6p25-p23. IRF4 functions as a key regulatory transcription factor in the development of human immune cells. The expression of IRF4 is essential for the differentiation of [[T cell|T lymphocytes]] and [[B cell|B lymphocytes]] as well as certain myeloid cells.

IRF4 is a transcription factor belonging to the Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) family of transcription factors. In contrast to some other IRF family members, IRF4 expression is not initiated by interferons; rather, IRF4 expression is promoted by a variety of bioactive stimuli, including antigen receptor engagement, [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS), IL-4, and CD40. IRF4 can function either as an activating or an inhibitory transcription factor depending on its transcription cofactors. IRF4 frequently cooperates with the cofactors B-cell lymphoma 6 protein ([[Bcl6]]) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells ([[NFAT]]s). IRF4 expression is limited to cells of the immune system, in particular T cells, B cells, [[macrophage]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s.
