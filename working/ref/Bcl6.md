Bcl-6 (B-cell lymphoma 6) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BCL6 gene. BCL6 is a master transcription factor for regulation of T follicular helper cells ([[follicular helper T-cell|TFH]] cells) proliferation. BCL6 has three evolutionary conserved structural domains. The interaction of these domains with corepressors allows for germinal center development and leads to [[B-cell]] proliferation.

Bcl-6 is a master transcription factor for the regulation of T follicular helper cells (TFH cells). Bcl-6 is expressed when the cytokines [[IL-6]] and/or [[IL-21]] are recognized; these cytokines can be produced by antigen presenting cells (APCs: B cells, [[dendritic cell]]s, or [[macrophage]]s) when activated. This occurs when a na√Øve T helper cell recognizes antigen and needs to migrate to the follicle as a T follicular helper cell (TFH cell). TFH cells are vital to the generation of germinal centers in the follicles of secondary lymphoid organs, where B cells divide and help fight infections.

As a master transcription factor, BCL6 interacts with a variety of co-repressors and other proteins to influence the T cell lineage. BCL6 has been shown to modulate the STAT-dependent Interleukin 4 ([[IL-4]]) responses of B cells[citation needed] and suppress the production of BCL2.

Importantly, Bcl-6 should only be expressed when there is an antigen present and further stimulation of the immune system is necessary, since BCL6 prevents cell death ([[apoptosis]]). Unchecked growth can lead to lymphomas. Normally, the action of BCL6 is negatively regulated by the gene [[PRDM1]] encoding the transcription factor [[Blimp-1]]. The antagonistic effect with Blimp-1 is a powerful role of BCL6, because it shuts off the normal pathway of differentiation toward other cell types.
