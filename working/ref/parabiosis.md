Parabiosis, meaning "living beside", is a laboratory technique to study physiology. It combines two living organisms which are joined surgically to develop a single, shared physiological system. Parabiosis is used in the study of areas such as obesity, biological aging, stem cell research, tissue regeneration, diabetes, organ transplantation, tumor biology, and endocrinology.
