IL-21 is expressed in activated human [[helper T cell|CD4+ T-cell]]s but not in most other tissues. In addition, IL-21 expression is up-regulated in Th2 and Th17 subsets of T helper cells, as well as T follicular cells. In fact, it was shown that IL-21 can be used to identify peripheral T follicular helper cells. Furthermore, IL-21 is expressed in NK T cells regulating the function of these cells.

Interleukin-21 is also produced by [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] (HL) cancer cells (which is surprising because IL-21 was thought to be produced only in T cells). This observation may explain a great deal of the behavior of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma including clusters of other immune cells gathered around HL cells in cultures. Targeting IL-21 may be a potential treatment or possibly a test for HL. Notably, IL21 is a key signal triggering proliferation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells.
