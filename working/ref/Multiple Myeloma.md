_Myeloma,_ also called _multiple myeloma,_ is a cancer of the plasma cells. [[Plasma cells]] are white blood cells that make [[Antibody|antibodies]] that protect us from infection. In myeloma, the cells grow too much, crowding out normal cells in the bone marrow that make red blood cells, platelets, and other white blood cells.

- _Multiple myeloma,_ the most common type of plasma cell tumor, develops in the bone marrow and can spread throughout the body.
- _Solitary plasmacytoma_ is a single plasma cell tumor that develops in one part of the body, often in a bone.
- _Extramedullary plasmacytoma_ is a plasma cell tumor that develops outside of the bones in soft tissue, such as the lung or throat.
