# Materials
---
- Complete RPMI, sterile-filtered 
	- 10% FBS, 1% Pen Strep
- 15mL conical tubes
- 96-well round-bottom plate
- 5mL polystyrene flow tubes
- FA-3 staining buffer: PBS
	- 2% FBS
	- 2.5mM EDTA
- Flow antibodies
- Human FcX
- UltraComp beads
- Live/Dead stain
- Aluminum foil or light-safe box
- Cell fixative (ex. 4% paraformaldehyde)


# Procedure
---

## 1. Thaw
---
1. Prepare materials.
2. Open and prepare BSC.
3. Fill/label 15mL conical tubes (1 per sample) with 14mL complete RPMI and warm to 37C.
4. Prepare labeled 96-well plate.
5. Transfer samples to dry ice.
6. Thaw samples 3 at a time. Remove when the sides have thawed but there is still a frozen core.
7. Open tubes carefully to vent gas.
8. Dropwise, add 1mL of the warm RPMI to the tubes. Mix thoroughly to resuspend cells.
9. Transfer the suspension to 15mL tube w/RPMI. Pipette slowly to avoid heat shock. Wash vial.
10. Spin tubes at 400g for 3 min.
11. During spin, count using trypan blue. Viability should be in the high 80s-90 percent if done well.
12. Calculate the resuspension density needed to seed an appropriate number of cells per well.Â 

## 2. Plate
---
1. When spin is done, aspirate all media and resuspend in volume of FA-3.
2. Flick the FA-3 off the plate and wick plate upside down on a paper towel for 3s.
3. Plate all samples first. Try to plate at least 2 million cells for 1 million events.
4. Pool all unused sample to use for FMOs and Aqua V single stain control.
5. Vortex UltraComp beads for 30s on high.
6. Place 1 drop of beads per compensation well or unstained control.
7. Dilute and evenly distribute sample into FMO wells and 1 unstained cell well.
8. Spin plate at 400g for 3 min.
9. During spin, prepare 1:20 (5%) dilution of human FcX blocker in FA-3 at 100uL/well blocking volume.

## 3. Block
---
1. After spin, inspect plate for pelleted cells and beads.
2. Flick the supernatant off and wick plate.
3. Add plain FA-3 to wells containing beads and unstained cell controls.
4. Add human FcX dilution to cells that will be stained. Mix thoroughly.
5. Block for 10 min at room temperature

## 4. Stain
---
1. During block, prepare stain at a staining volume of 100uL/well. It is okay if the plate blocks for more than 10 min; put on ice.
	- Reconstitute Aqua V 1:500 in FA-3.
	- Prepare master mix and FMOs in FA-3/Aqua buffer from (a) with added 5% FcX.
2. Spin down blocked plate. Flick the supernatant off and wick.
3. Stain for 30 minutes at 4C in the dark.

## 5. Fix (optional)
---
1. Spin down blocked plate. Flick the supernatant off and wick.
2. Make 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS or fixative of choice. Plan for 100uL fixing volume.
3. Fix cells for 15 min at RT.
4. During the fixing step, create labeled FACS tubes.
5.  Spin down cells at 500g for 5 min. Note that this is different from all the other spins.
6.  Flick off supernatant and wick.
7. Resuspend fixed cells in 200uL FA-3.

## 6. Final Preparation
---
1. Cells can either sit in the fridge in plate or tubes overnight without evaporation issues.
2. When ready, transfer the 200uL suspension from each well into tubes. Mix well.
3. Check the bottoms of the wells to make sure no cells remain.
