# Ammonia detoxification promotes CD8+Â T cell memory development by urea and citrulline cycles

## Summary
- Memory T-cells clear ammonia to promote memory development
	- T-cells upregulate carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 by hydroxybutylation
		- The CP pathway builds up arginine
			- Arginine is metabolized by Arg2 to urea and ornithine
			- Arginine is metabolized by NO synthases to NO and citrulline
			- Dual metabolic clearance of urea via arginine

## Innovative Methods Used
- 

## Major findings and relevance
- Relevant to improving T-cell focused immunotherapies
