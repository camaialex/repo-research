# Role of the Thymus in Murine Leuk√¶mia
**Foundational Paper**

**Key observation:** thymectomy results in control of murine [[leukemia]]

**Experimental Design**
3 groups of [[Ak mouse|Ak]] mice
- Injected with cell-free leukemic extracts
- Injected with extracts _and_ subjected to thymectomy
- Injected with saline

**Results**
Mice injected with leukemic extracts developed leukemia unless they were subjected to thymectomy.

**Discussion**
- The thymus plays some role in the development of leukemia
- There is an important type of cancer cell in leukemia that seems to arise from the thymus
- Leukemia can be induced by cell-free extracts, provided there is a thymus present
