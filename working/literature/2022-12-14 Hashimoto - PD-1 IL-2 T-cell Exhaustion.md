# PD-1 combination therapy with IL-2 modifies CD8+ T cell exhaustion program

## Summary
- Mechanistic investigation into the synergy between PD-1 and IL-2 therapy
- Discovered that IL-2 can change the differentiation trajectory of CD8+ stem-like T-cells

## Innovative Methods Used
- 

## Major findings and relevance
- PD-1+TCF1+ stem-like CD8+ T cells ([[progenitor exhausted T-cell|Progenitor Exhausted T-cell]]) are not fate-locked
	- IL-2 caused differentiation into T-cells resembling acute response to viral infection
- Relevant to cancer immunotherapy
