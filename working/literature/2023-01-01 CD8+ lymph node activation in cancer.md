# CD8+Â T cell activation in cancer comprises an initial activation phase in lymph nodes followed by effector differentiation within the tumor

- CD8+ T-cells within [[ref_tdln|tumor-draining lymph nodes]] were transcriptionally and epigenetically similar to [[marker_tcf1|TCF1]]-positive stem-like resident T-cells ([[progenitor exhausted T-cell|Progenitor Exhausted T-cell]]?) in the TME
	- Suggests that TDLN cells are predecessors
- Suggests two-phase activation
	- Priming in lymph node
	- Acquisition of specific programs at the site of infection or cancer
