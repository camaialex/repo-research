# Heparan sulfate regulates [[IL-21]] bioavailability and signal strength that control germinal center B cell selection and differentiation

- The [[follicular helper T-cell|TFH]] cytokine [[IL-21]] acts in conjunction with [[BCR]] and [[CD40]] to prioritize differentiation into antibody-secreting cells
- B-cells in the germinal center show reduced IL-21 signaling
	- Mediated by low heparan sulfate
