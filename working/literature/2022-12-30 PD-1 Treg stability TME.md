# Deletion of PD-1 destabilizes the lineage identity and metabolic fitness of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells

- Tregs express high amounts of PD-1 in the TME
- What is the role of PD-1 in these immunosuppressive cells?
- Knocking out PD-1 resulted in reduced immunosuppression and proliferation
	- Also lowered lipid metabolism
- aPD-1 therapy can weaken the foothold that Tregs have in the TME

**Novel model system**
- Conditional flox knockout of PD-1 in Tregs
- Both PD-1 and PD-1KO exist in TME?
