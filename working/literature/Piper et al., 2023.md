# Simultaneous targeting of PD-1 and IL-2Rβγ with radiation therapy inhibits pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis
---
## Abstract
- [[PDAC]] that is responsive to radiotherapy expresses more [[CD122|IL-2Rb]] and [[IL-2Ry]] than [[CD25|IL-2Ra]]
	- Agonism of [[IL-2 receptor]] linked to expansion of [[effector T-cell]]s
	- Off-target effects include binding to non-signaling [[CD25]] monomer and expansion of Tregs
- PD1-IL2v is a recombinant [[IL-2]] that is targeted to [[PD-1]]
	- Variant protein sequence abolishes binding to [[CD25|IL-2Ra]]
