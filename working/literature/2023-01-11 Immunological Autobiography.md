# An immunological autobiography: my year as a COVID-19 vaccine trial participant

- Collected own biological specimens after vaccination to track response to vaccine
- Amount to a "well-documented anecdote"
- Combines explanation of cytokine biology and immunology with a strong writing voice
- "Ethical approval was granted retrospectively" lmao
