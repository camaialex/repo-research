# Nitro-oleic acid regulates T cell activation through post-translational modification of calcineurin

- Nitro-fatty acids demonstrate anti-inflammatory properties in mice
	- Electrophiles
	- Interfere with signaling pathways by modifying proteins
- Nitro-oleic acid
	- Decrease T-cell proliferation
	- Downregulate activation markers:
		- [[CD25]]
		-  [[CD71]]
	- Downregulate cytokines:
		- [[IL-2]]
		- [[IL-4]]
		- [[IFNg]]
	- Inhibits [[NFAT]] via regulation of [[calcineurin]]
		- Mechanism of action a nitroalkylation of calcineurin
