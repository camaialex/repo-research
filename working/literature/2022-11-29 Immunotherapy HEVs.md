# Cancer immunotherapies transition endothelial cells into HEVs that generate TCF1+Â T lymphocyte niches through a feed-forward loop

## Summary
- Presence of tertiary lymphoid structures is associated with good prognosis in cancer
- Immunotherapies trigger differentiation of venules into HEV
	- Create lymphocyte niches
	- Requires continuous CD8 and NK derived signaling

## Innovative Methods Used
- 

## Major findings and relevance
