# Helminth egg derivatives as proregenerative immunotherapies

- The immune system is an important regulator of tissue repair
- Stimulation of cytokines is important to starting the process
- Helminth egg derivatives can
	- Stimulate the production of [[IL-4]]
	- Inhibit the production of [[IL-17]] by [[γδ T-cell]]s
	- These factors together improve tissue repair while decreasing fibrosis
