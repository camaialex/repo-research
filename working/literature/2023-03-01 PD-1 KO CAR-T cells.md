# Long-term persistence and functionality of adoptively transferred antigen-specific T cells with genetically ablated PD-1 expression

- What if we...knocked out [[PD-1]] on [[CAR-T cell]]s???
	- PD-1 engagement is associated with dysfunctional immune response in cancer
- This is controversial because PD-1 could be used for normal physiological function
- PD-1 KO seems to preserve main differentiation and memory-forming functions of CAR-T cells during adoptive transfer
	- Functionality and longevity preserved
