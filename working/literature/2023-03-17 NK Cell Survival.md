# An XBP1s-PIM-2 positive feedback loop controls IL-15-mediated survival of natural killer cells

- [[XBP1s]] is TF downstream of [[IL-15]] and [[AKT]] signaling
	- Promotes cell survival
- Mechanism of NK survival by XBP1s
	- XBP1s targets [[PIM-2]] (anti-apoptotic)
		- PIM-2 phosphorylates XBP1s, stabilizing it
	- XBP1s recruits [[Tbet]] to [[IFNg]] gene
