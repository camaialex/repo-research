# Systematic Interrogation of Tumor Cell Resistance to Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer

- What tumor-intrinsic factors contribute to resistance to CAR-T therapy
- Cas9 [[CRISPR Screen]] on [[MSLN]]-expressing cancer cells. Examples:
	- Disruption of [[GPI]] anchor biosynthesis and attachment resulted in immune evasion
	- Disruption of death receptor pathway resulted in immune evasion
	- Disruption of tumor-intrinsic transcriptional programs
