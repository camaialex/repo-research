# Immune cells use active tugging forces to distinguish affinity and accelerate evolution

- Cells are known to exert mechanical force on surroundings to make fate decisions
- Evidence suggests [[B cell]]s use mechanical force to actively extract antigen from other cell surfaces
	- "Tug of war" in which the [[BCR]] must have enough affinity to yank the antigen away
