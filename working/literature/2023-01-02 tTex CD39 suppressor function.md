# Hypoxia drives CD39-dependent suppressor function in exhausted T cells to limit antitumor immunity

- tTex (terminally exhausted T-cells) are resistant and even counterproductive in immunotherapy context
- Analysis of intratumoral tTex CD8+ cells
	- Share similar transcriptional program as Tregs
	- Suppress T-cell proliferation in a CD39-dependent manner
		- CD39 induced by hypoxia
