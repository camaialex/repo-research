# Spatial positioning of immune hotspots reflects the interplay between B and T cells in lung squamous cell carcinoma

- Non-[[tertiary lymphoid structure]]s exist in LUSQ called "immune hotspots"
- Transcriptomic profiling
- More intratumoral immune hotspots correlated with poorer outcomes
	- Enriched in B-cells
- Increased intratumoral hotspots compared to peritumoral hotspots could be indicative of failed immune response
