# Intrathymic dendritic cell-biased precursors promote human T cell lineage specification through IRF8-driven transmembrane TNF

- Dendritic-like cells in the thymus are critical for lymphocyte development
- Showed DC precursors relied on [[IRF8]] to express tm[[TNF]] (membrane-bound version of cytokine)
	- Promoted differentiation of thymic precursors into T-lineage specified precursors
	- Through selective activation of [[TNFR2]] over [[TNFR1]]
