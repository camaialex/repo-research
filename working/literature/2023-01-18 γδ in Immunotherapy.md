# γδ T cells are effectors of immunotherapy in cancers with HLA class I defects

- [[DNA mismatch repair]] deficient cancers are thought to respond well to [[immune checkpoint inhibition]] due to presence of [[neoantigen]]
- **However,** eliminating expression of [[B2M]] (beta-2 microglobulin, component of HLA class I) doesn't affect response to ICI
	- This means something other than CD8+ T-cells are involved
- Found that infiltration of gamma-delta T-cells was associated with this response
