# Identification of Interleukin-1 by Functional Screening as a Key Mediator of Cellular Expansion and Disease Progression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia

**Question**: What cytokines contribute to disease progression in [[AML]]?

**Methods:**
- _Ex vivo_ cytokine panel

**Results:**
- [[IL-1]] induced expansion of AML progenitors in 2/3 of patient samples
- IL-1 receptors were upregulated
- Silencing [[IL1R]] resulted in suppression of disease progression
- IL-1's effect found to be mediated by [[p38MAPK]] phosphorylation
