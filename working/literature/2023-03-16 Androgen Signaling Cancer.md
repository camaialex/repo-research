# Androgen Signaling Contributes to Sex Differences in Cancer by Inhibiting NF-ÎºB Activation in T Cells and Suppressing Antitumor Immunity

- Male mice showed increased tumor growth rate compared to females
	- Effect was not seen in immunosuppressed mice
- Androgen-mediated expression of [[USP18]]
	- Inhibition of [[TAK1]] phosphorylation
		- Activation of [[NFkB]]
- Inhibition of [[testosterone]] synthesis enhanced [[T cell]] antitumor activity
