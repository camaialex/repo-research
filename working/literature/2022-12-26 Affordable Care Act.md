# The Affordable Care Act
- March 2010
- **Goal:** Universal healthcare
	- Cooperation among stakeholders in healthcare: employers, citizens, government
	- Make healthcare more affordable
	- Reduce unnecessary spending
- **Emphasis on preventative care**
- **Individual mandate**: Requirement that all individuals purchase some form of health insurance
	- Increases pool of healthy insurers
	- Spreads out risk
	- Subsidizes the disadvantaged
- **Bars insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions**
	- Used to be only for those under 19 #check

# Relevant issues
- Constitutionality
	- Is the individual mandate an infringement on personal freedoms?
	- Is the federal government overriding the 10th Amendment by ensuring states are enforcing it?
- Other concerns
	- Overwhelming healthcare with new patients
	- Disrupting current healthcare structures

My thoughts
- A given in society is a buy-in; how much is too much?
- Due to constantly evolving healthcare, we need to constantly reassess the "minimum" healthcare requirement
