# IL-21R signal reprogramming cooperates with CD40 and BCR signals to select and differentiate germinal center B cells

- [[CD40]] and [[BCR]] signaling are rewired in germinal centers
	- Synergistically induce [[c-MYC]] and [[p-S6]]
- How does [[IL-21]] affect B-cell differentiation?
	- IL-21 + CD40 affects B-cells differently from BCR + CD40
		- [[Plasma cell]]s
		- [[B-memory cell precursor]]s
