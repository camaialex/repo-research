# Liver X receptor controls follicular helper T cell differentiation via repression of TCF-1

- [[LXR]] (Liver X Receptor) is a critical regulator of sterol metabolism
	- LXR regulates T-cell differentiation but mechanism is unknown
- Finding: LXR _negatively_ regulates [[follicular helper T-cell]]s
	- Via negative regulation of [[TCF-1]]
