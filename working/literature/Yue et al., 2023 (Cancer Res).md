## Abstract
- What is the mechanism of immune escape under H2S microenvironment?
- Depletion of H2S in vivo resulted in:
	- Decreased [[Treg cell|Treg]] abundance
	- Increased [[cytotoxic T cell|CD8+ T-cell]]:Treg ratio
	- Enhanced efficacy of anti-[[PD-1]] and anti-[[CTLA-4]] immunotherapies
- H2S increases Treg abundance
	- Persulfidation of Cys119 of [[ENO1]]
- H2S inhibits CD8+ T-cell migration
	- Persulfidation of Cys25 of [[ELK4]]
		- Increased expression of [[AAK-1]]
- Could sulfur amino acid restricted diet (SARD) be used to boost the efficacy of immunotherapies in colon cancer?
