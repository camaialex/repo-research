# Neutrophil conversion to a tumor-killing phenotype underpins effective microbial therapy

- Cancer creates a chronic inflammatory response that resembles a failed wound-healing process
- Intratumoral injection of microbial bioparticles altered the TME
	- Substantial increase in activated neutrophils
	- Led to tissue remodeling and repression of tumor growth
	- Neutrophils shifted towards antimicrobial programs
	- Neutrophils began expressing chemokines that regulate T-cell homing
