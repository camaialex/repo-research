# Major histocompatibility class I antigenic peptides derived from translation of pre-mRNAs generate immune tolerance

- Introns are translated into antigenic peptides and presented on [[MHC-I]]...but how?

- MHC-I epitope SL8 inserted into a beta-globin gene generates [[immune tolerance]]
	- Growth of sarcoma expressing SL8 was suppressed in mice that did not have this antigen
- Non-AUG initiation
- ??? splicing
- Explains why tissue-specific splicing is tolerated
