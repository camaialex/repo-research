# Elevated transferrin receptor impairs T cell metabolism and function in systemic lupus erythematosus

- T-cells are metabolically abnormal in SLE
	- Many dysregulated pathways are related to iron metabolism
- [[CRISPR Screen]]
	- Identified [[Transferrin]] receptor [[CD71]]
		- Critical for [[Th1 cell]] differentiation
		- Inhibits induced [[Treg cell|Treg]]s
	- CD71 upregulation is exaggerated in SLE-associated T-cells
		- A result of endosomal recycling
- Targeting CD71 resulted in:
	- Inhibition of Th1 and [[Th17|Th17]]s
	- Enhanced activity of Tregs
	- Reduced [[kidney]] pathology
	- Increased [[IL-10]] from CD4+ cells
- CD71 associated with worse outcomes in SLE patients
