# Epigenetic modification of _CSDE1_ locus dictates immune recognition of nascent tumorigenic cells
- How do tumors modulate their immunogenicity?
- To investigate, investigators used a single **tumor-repopulating cell** (clonal) to form tumors in mice
	- Immunogenicity of tumor cells is _intrinsically determined_ based on [[STAT1]] activation
		- In the absence of immune pressure
	- STAT1 activity was controlled in turn by epigenetic regulation of CSDE1
