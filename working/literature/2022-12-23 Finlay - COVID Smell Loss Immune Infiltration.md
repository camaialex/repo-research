# Persistent post-COVID-19 smell loss is associated with immune cell infiltration and altered gene expression in olfactory epithelium

## Summary
- Olfactory biopsies from patient who lost their sense of smell reveals an immune signature
	- T-cell driven gamma expression
	- Loss of M2 anti-inflammatory macs
	- Enrichment of [[marker_cd207|CD207]]+ [[dendritic cell|Dendritic Cell]]s
- The olfactory epithelium (sustentacular cells) showed an adaptation to inflammatory signaling

## Innovative Methods Used
