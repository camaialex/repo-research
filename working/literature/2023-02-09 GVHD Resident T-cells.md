# Graft-versus-host disease is locally maintained in target tissues by resident progenitor-like T cells

- [[Graft-versus-host disease]] results from donor T-cells attacking recipient tissues
- Technique: [[parabiosis]] of mice in GVHD model
- Current model dictates that GVHD is maintained by constant recruitment of effectors from blood
	- **This group shows that GVHD in mice is maintained by resident T-cells locally in the tissue**
