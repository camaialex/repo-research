# OXPHOS promotes apoptotic resistance and cellular persistence in TH17 cells in the periphery and tumor microenvironment

## Summary
- T-cell proliferation and cytokine production are energetically costly
- The effects of metabolic state on T-cell activity are poorly characterized

## Innovative Methods Used
- 

## Major findings and relevance
- Th17 cell cultured in OXPHOS conditions displayed increased apoptotic resistance compared to counterparts cultured in glycolytic conditions
