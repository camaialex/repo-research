# Thioredoxin-interacting protein is essential for memory T cell formation via the regulation of the redox metabolism

- Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of CD4+ memory T-cell formation
- Contraction phase of memory T-cell formation
- Thioredoxin-activating protein (Txnip) regulates oxidoreductase
	- Key role in controlling generation of memory T-cells
	- Does so via Nrf2-biliverdin axis
