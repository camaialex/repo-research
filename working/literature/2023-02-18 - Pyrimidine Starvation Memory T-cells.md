# Pyrimidine de novo synthesis inhibition selectively blocks effector but not memory T cell development

- A common treatment for autoimmune diseases is through inhibiting _de novo_ pyrimidine synthesis via [[DHODH|dihydroorotate dehydrogenase]]
	- Targets rapidly-dividing cells
- Found that this inhibits the expansion of effector T-cells but **not** memory T-cells
- This was dependent on a small time-frame in which developing effectors have higher proliferation rates and lower pyrimidine synthesis capability
