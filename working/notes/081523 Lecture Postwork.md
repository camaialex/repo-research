- **Describe how the signal transduction schema (ligand, receptor, amplification via second messengers, response) is followed by diverse cell signaling pathways.** [3/5]
	- GsPCR
		- Binds ligand
		- Galpha subunit GAP activity binds GTP
		- Dissociates from beta and gamma subunits and diffuses across membrane
		- Inhibits adenylate cyclase
		- Prevents cAMP buildup
		- Signal is terminated by GTPase activity, scavenging second messengers
	- GiPCR
		- Binds ligand
		- Galpha subunit GAP activity binds GTP
		- Stimulates adenylate cyclase
		- Buildup of cAMP causes downstream signaling
		- Signal is terminated by GTPase activity, scavenging second messengers
	- GqPCR
		- Binds ligand
		- Galpha subunit GAP activity binds GTP
		- Dissociates from beta and gamma subunits and diffuses across membrane
		- Hydrolyzes ??? into DAG and IP3
		- IP3 stimulates PKA?
		- DAG does something else
	- RTK
		- Two monomers each bind a ligand and dimerize
		- Each monomer has kinase activity that phosphorylates the other
		- Triggers a series of downstream enzymatic reactions
- **Provide examples of receptors, 2nd messengers, and signal termination.** [4/5]
	- Example of GPCR: 
	- Example of RTK-like: Ras-MAP
	- Other second-messengers: DAG/IP3, cAMP
	- Signal termination:
		- Ubiquitination
		- Hydrolysis of cAMP
- **Appraise the diversity of G-protein linked second messengers and their functions.** [5/5]
	- Answered above
- **Describe how components of a signaling pathway relay a signal, using both positive and negative mechanisms of regulation.** [3/5]
	- Answered above
- **Distinguish genetic and cytological characteristics between stem cells versus terminally differentiated cells.** [2/5]
	- Genetically, stem cells ???
	- Histologically, stem cells are usually rounder and look more "regular" than terminally differentiated cells which often have highly specialized shapes
- **Diagram checkpoints of the cell cycle and the factors involved in its control.**
	- G1/S checkpoint: cyclin E
	- S/M checkpoint: cyclin B
- **Compare apoptosis and necrosis in terms of morphology, typical triggers of the two phenomena, and relative importance in physiological and pathological processes** [4/5]
	- Necrosis is unintentional cell death that results in the externalization of cellular contents
		- Typically triggered by disease, pathology, trauma
		- Can involve multiple cells at a time
		- Immunogenic, can cause inflammation and death of nearby cells
	- Apoptosis is controlled, programmed cell death that preserves membrane integrity.
		- Typically a normal cell activity, but can be triggered by disease or trauma to nearby cells
		- Typically involves single cell at a time
		- Non-immunogenic, can control infection by containing it within apoptotic cells?
- **Differentiate stimulus, duration, and tissue response for reversible vs irreversible cell injury** [4/5]
	- Reversible
		- Mild stimulus
		- Short-term/chronic
		- Response: cell adaptation by proliferation, growth, morphology
	- Irreversible
		- Noxious stimulus
		- Long-term/chronic
		- Response: necrosis
- **Recognize the histology of atrophy, hyperplasia, hypertrophy, metaplasia** [4/5]
	- Atrophy: smaller cytoplasm
	- Hyperplasia: more cells than expected
	- Hypertrophy: larger cytoplasm, more active transcription (diffuse nuclear staining)
	- Metaplasia: a NORMAL tissue type where it isn't supposed to be
- **Describe stimuli that lead to cellular adaptive changes** [3/5]
	- Atrophy: lack of perfusion/nutrients, disuse, disease
	- Hyperplasia: proliferative factors, injury that requires healing
	- Hypertrophy: growth factors, (over)use
	- Metaplasia: adverse conditions that a different tissue type is better-suited to handle (ex. acid reflux)
- **List factors that determine if cellular changes are reversible** [2/5]
	- Does it impact major organelles like the mitochondria?
	- Is it traumatic?
	- How many cells are affected?
	- How long does the stimulus last?
