### First Pass
- **Describe the general makeup of the connective tissue proper including the types and proportion of fibers and fluids in the extracellular matrix.**  [3/5]
	- Connective tissue proper is categorized into three subtypes: loose, dense irregular, and dense regular.
		- Loose connective tissue has the lowest proportion of cells to ground substance and fibers.
		- Dense connective tissue has a higher proportion of fibers, arranged unidirectionally (regular) or in 2+ directions (irregular).
- **Correlate the morphologies of the most common connective tissue cells (fibroblasts, fibrocytes, unilocular adipocytes, multilocular adipocytes, macrophages/mononuclear phagocytes, mast cells, plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, reticular cells) with their functions and locations, including a) key molecular components, b) organizations, c) unique functions, and d) prominent locations in the body.**  [3/5]
	- Fibroblasts/fibrocytes are collagen fiber-producing cells found in the connective tissue, particularly underneath highly proliferative epithelia.
	- Unilocular adipocytes store energy in the form of fat throughout the body's white/yellow fat. They each contain one large vesicle of fat, hence the term "unilocular"
	- Multilocular adipocytes store energy in the form of brown fat, producing heat during nonshivering thermogenesis. They are characterized by multiple smaller vesicles of fat.
	- Monocytes are found in the blood but differentiate into macrophages when they arrive in tissue compartments. They are phagocytes which also act as APCs and stimulate other immune cells through cytokine signaling. They are found in virtually every tissue in the body. They have large cytoplasm with a notched, diffuse nucleus.
	- Mast cells are found in the skin. They contribute to anaphylaxis and the inflammatory response through degranulating histamine and other inflammatory signaling molecules. They are mononuclear with many granules.
	- Plasma cells are found in lymphatic tissue like spleen and lymph node as well as patrolling the body(?). Their primary job is to produce antibody. They are characterized by basophilic staining which marks active ribosomes and diffuse, euchromatic nuclear staining.
	- Lymphocytes (B and T-cells) are the bulk of the adaptive arm of the immune system. They are found in lymphatic tissue like spleen and lymph node. They coordinate both the humoral and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses. They are characterized by round cellular shape with little cytoplasm and a large, dark-staining nucleus.
	- Eosinophils contribute to anti-parasite immunity as well as allergy. They contain many eosinophilic granules and have bilobar nuclei. They are found in the blood and tissue.
	- **Reticular cells ???**
- **Describe and identify general characteristics of connective tissues.**  [4/5]
	- Connective tissues are cell-poor and ECM-rich. They contain one or both of ground substance (assortment of glycoproteins and sugars) and fibers (collagen, elastin, reticular fibers). They can be found under epithelia or on the internal structures of the body.
- **Correlate the histological structures of the 3 most common types of fibers with their molecular makeup, function, and distribution**   [4/5]
	- Collagen: made up of hydroxylated triple helices that spontaneously self-assemble into collagen fibrils. Strong, unidirectional fibers that provide tensile strength and resistance.
	- Elastin: polymer of elastin monomers? Provides rebound after stretch. Found in webs in elastic connective tissue.
	- Reticular fibers: require special stain to see because they are so small. Not sure what they're made of. Act as a scaffold for cell attachment.
- **Describe histopathology of Elhers Danlos syndrome.**  [0/5]
- **Correlate the structures of the 3 most common ground substances found in the ECM with their function.** [2/5]

	- Protectin
	- three-letter acronym thingy
- **Evaluate the effects of specific complement deficiencies** [2/5]
	- C3 deficiency: chronic infections by encapsulated bacteria, lupus-like syndrome failure to clear immune complexes
	- there was another one but I don't remember which one
- **Explain the use of plasma CH50 levels in the assessment of disease** [4/5]
	- CH50 measures the activation of the classical complement pathway
	- Antibody-opsonized sheep RBCs are added to a blood sample. This activates complement which then mediates hemolysis. The degree of hemolysis is measured.
	- In the case of complement deficiency due to chronic disease or acute infection, there will be less hemolysis.
- **Describe the forces involved in regulating fluid movement across a capillary: hydrostatic and oncotic pressures (i) within the capillary and (ii) outside the capillary, in the interstitial fluid (Starling capillary relationship).** [4/5]
	- On the arterial end of the capillary, high hydrostatic pressure forces fluid out of the vessel.
	- In the middle, the pressures are relatively equivalent.
	- On the venous end of the capillary, high protein concentration within the vein draws fluid back into the vasculature (oncotic pressure)
- **Differentiate between exudative versus transudative fluid, including the mechanisms underlying these two processes.** [5/5]
	- Exudate is water + other stuff, usually due to a disease process, inflammation, or trauma.
	- Transudate is mostly water, usually due to high hydrostatic pressure
- **Evaluate how disturbances in fluid movement cause congestion, hyperemia, edema and effusions.** [2/5]
	- Usually, blood flow is laminar
	- Turbulent blood flow is detected by the body and results in the release of cytokines
	- This signals for the formation of plaques, which cause several problems if the plaque embolizes.
		- If it causes a thrombosis, vessels upstream of the thrombus are at high pressure and can leak fluid (edema)
		- If the thrombus is in a vital vessel like the ones in the lung and heart, it can impair the ability of the heart to move blood (congestion)
	- Not sure how it causes hyperemia
- **Explain the role of the lymphatic system in regulation of interstitial fluid composition and volume.** [4/5]
	- The lymphatic system scavenges interstitial fluid and returns it to cardiovascular circulation to maintain blood volume and prevent edema.
- **Define hemorrhage, infarct and shock.** [1/5]
	- Hemorrhage: blood where it isn't supposed to be (leaking out of vessels into interstitium or outside)
	- Infarct: cutting off blood flow to a part of the body?
	- Shock: life-threatening loss of function due to a catastrophic drop in blood pressure, due to pathologically increased vascular permeability???
- **Describe the temporal cellular responses to tissue injury and inflammation that lead to resolution or repair** [3/5]
	- Hemostasis (immediate to hours)
		- Platelets and RBCs form a thrombus at the site of injury
	- Inflammation (hours to days)
		- Leukocyte infiltration removes (or attempts to) cell debris and pathogens
	- Proliferation (days to weeks)
		- Fibroblasts and epithelial cells begin to proliferate/secrete fibers to rebuild site of injury
	- Remodeling (weeks to months)
		- Extensive changes in tissue microenvironment restore tissue to a normal state

- **Explain the creation of granulation tissue and fibrous scar tissue, including the types of collagen involved** [2/5]

- **Compare portal vs systemic circulation** [2/5]
	- Portal circulation involves blood passing through two beds of capillaries before joining the veins
- **Explain the role of anastomoses and retroflow in collateral circulation pathways** [1/5]

	- ???
- **Correlate histological composition of different types of arteries, veins and capillaries with function and location in the body.** [3/5]
	- Elastic tissue/smooth muscle (size of tunica media): thicker in arteries which need more rebound strength

	- Apparent tunica intima: ???
- **Assess the roles of the hydrostatic pressure, osmotic pressure,  and lymphatic drainage on the maintenance of tissue fluid homeostasis in connective tissues** [4/5]
	- Hydrostatic pressure: forces fluid into the interstitial space, washing cells
	- Osmotic pressure: passive flow of fluid back into vasculature after being pushed out by hydrostatic pressure
	- Lymphatic drainage: picks up rest of interstitial fluid to prevent edema and maintain blood volume
- **Describe the three histological layers (or tunics) and their sublayers in a "typical" vessel** [3/5]
	- Tunica intima: endothelium and very thin connective tissue, serves to modulate vessel permeability
	- Tunica media: layers of smooth muscle and elastic fibers, serves to contract to produce vasoconstriction and rebound to push boluses of blood forward continuously
	- Tunica adventitia: dense irregular connective tissue made of collagen fibers that resists tearing with movement
