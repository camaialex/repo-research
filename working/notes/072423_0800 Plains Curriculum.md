# Orientation to the Plains Curriculum

13 courses
- 10 main units (body systems)
- 2 professional courses
- 1 mentored activity
- 5 Traverse weeks

DOCS longitudinal clinical skills coaching
- Make mistakes here rather than later

## Weekly Schedule

### Monday
1. Chief concern: sets the tone and clinical context for the rest of the week's content
	Don't try to memorize all of it. It's just information
2. Medical Sciences: 
	1. PM: Mostly rotational work (hands-on, pathology, anatomy labs, etc.)

### Tuesday
1. Medical Sciences
2. Unstructured PM
3. Journal club

### Wednesday
1. Molecules to Medicine
2. DOCS

### Thursday: 
1. Synthesis of medical sciences information (no new content)

### Prework
- Takes ~90 before Monday
- ~30 medical sci
- ~30 clinical skills
- ~30 Health and Society
- ~30 for Thursday stuff

### Friday
- EOW checkpoint
- Mimics STEP 1 timing
- Vista sessions: "untestable" stuff that is still important
- Facilitated review of quiz questions to increase suffering
	- Review 9 hardest questions
	- Review entire quiz

### Traverse Weeks
- High-stakes exams
	- Clinical standardized patient exams
	- Medical science practice board exams
	- Anatomy practicals
- **CUMULATIVE**
- Informational sessions
- Friday is usually free
	- Block off Mon-Thurs. Not full days but something _might_ happen
	- If traveling, leave AFTER Thursday night at 6pm

## If you fail EOC:
- You get one retake on similar material per test
- Pass = pass course without any impact on grading record (fail doesn't show up)
- So technically you could fail every EOC, pass the retake, and it looks like you passed every course first try

Exams are all in-person in the lab/CAPE or on ExamSoft

## Professionalism
1. Use courtesy titles always (Mr., Ms., Dr.) UNLESS there is an explicit invitation to use the first name
	1. Then still use courtesy titles in professional settings (clinic, public, etc.)
2. Medicine is (still) a hierarchy
