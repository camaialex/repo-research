# Learning How to Learn Medicine

Medicine ~ learning language
- Won't always have the right word at first but important to recognize key concepts

Learning process
1. Exposure to material
2. Building chunks
3. Encoding chunks 
4. Take a break (association/consolidation)
5. Self-test
6. Associate chunks
7. Spaced repetition

_Can make chunk schematics in Obsidian_
- Use #MED tag

Process of learning actually completes during retrieval, not initial exposure

Learning strategies
- "Lecturing" or teaching content
- Anki
	- Avoid building "card circuits" instead of learning how to actually apply the information
		- Don't use Anki for initial learning process, use for retrieval practice

Interleaving every __ minutes while studying

"Pre-rounding" questions
- Know what you don't know

Spaced repetition
- Every day for a week
- Every week for a month
- Every month for a year

Testing
- Start on hard questions
- Reduce cognitive load
	- Dump mnemonics, diagrams, chunks onto paper as soon as possible to free up working memory
- Don't change answers too often. First answer is often the best one

Exercise: Takeaways from session
1. Use chunks to free up working memory
2. Taking a break is essential to problem-solving
3. Anki is not the cure-all to med school
